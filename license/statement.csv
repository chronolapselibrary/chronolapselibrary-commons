"@emotion/cache@10.0.15","MIT","https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/tree/master/packages/cache","# @emotion/cache  ### createCache  `createCache` allows for low level customization of how styles get inserted by emotion. It's intended to be used with the [`<CacheProvider/>`](https://emotion.sh/docs/cache-provider) component to override the default cache, which is created with sensible defaults for most applications.  ```javascript import createCache from '@emotion/cache'  export const myCache = createCache({   key: 'my-prefix-key',   stylisPlugins: [     /* your plugins here */   ] }) ```  ### Primary use cases  - Using emotion in embedded contexts such as an `<iframe/>`  - Setting a [nonce](#nonce-string) on any `<style/>` tag emotion creates for security purposes  - Using emotion with a developer defined `<style/>` tag  - Using emotion with custom Stylis plugins  ## Options  ### `nonce`  `string`  A nonce that will be set on each style tag that emotion inserts for [Content Security Policies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).  ### `stylisPlugins`  `Function` | `Array<Function>`  A Stylis plugin or plugins that will be run by Stylis during preprocessing. [Read the Stylis docs to find out more](https://github.com/thysultan/stylis.js#plugins). This can be used for many purposes such as RTL.  ### `prefix`  `boolean` | `Function`, defaults to `true`  Allows changing Stylis's vendor prefixing settings. It can be a boolean or a function to dynamically set which properties are prefixed. [More information can be found in the Stylis docs](https://github.com/thysultan/stylis.js#vendor-prefixing).  ### `key`  `string`, defaults to `'css'`  The prefix before class names. It will also be set as the value of the `data-emotion` attribute on the style tags that emotion inserts and it's used in the attribute name that marks style elements in `renderStylesToString` and `renderStylesToNodeStream`. This is **required if using multiple emotion caches in the same app**.  ### `container`  `HTMLElement`  A DOM node that emotion will insert all of its style tags into. This is useful for inserting styles into iframes."

This is useful to identify different sheets.  #### speedy  This defines how rules are inserted. If it is true, rules will be inserted with [`insertRule`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleSheet/insertRule) which is very fast but doesn't allow rules to be edited in DevTools. If it is false, rules will be inserted by appending text nodes to style elements which is much slower than insertRule but allows rules to be edited in DevTools. By default, speedy is enabled in production and disabled in development.  #### maxLength  This defines the number of rules that are inserted into each style tag. This generally shouldn't be modified.  ### Methods  #### insert  This method inserts a single rule into the document. It **must** be a single rule otherwise an error will be thrown in speedy mode which is enabled by default in production.  #### flush  This method will remove all style tags that were inserted into the document.  ### Example with all options  ```jsx import { StyleSheet } from '@emotion/sheet'  const container = document.createElement('div')  document.head.appendChild(container)  const sheet = new StyleSheet({   nonce: 'some-nonce',   key: 'some-key',   container,   maxLength: 20 })  sheet.insert('html { color: hotpink; }')  sheet.flush() ```  # Thanks  This StyleSheet is based on [glamor's StyleSheet](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor) written by [Sunil Pai](https://github.com/threepointone). ❤️"

The only Stylis option that can be changed is `prefix`, the rest of the options are already set to the values shown below and cannot be changed. This package also only exports the constructer, so you have to do `new Stylis()` and use the result from that rather than directly calling `Stylis`. The result of that function also cannot be used to create a stylis instance unlike stylis.  ```js type Options = {   global: false,   preserve: false,   keyframe: false,   semicolon: true,   cascade: true,   compress: false,   prefix: boolean | ((key: string, value: string, context: number) => boolean) } ```  ```jsx import Stylis from '@emotion/stylis'  const stylis = new Stylis()  stylis('.css-hash', 'display:flex;') // .css-hash{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;} ```  ## Building this package  To build this package from a newer version of stylis, update the version of stylis that is installed as a devDependency and run `node build.js` in the directory of this package. This will read the source of stylis, transform it slightly, use the [Google Closure Compiler REST API](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/gettingstarted_api) to minify it, format it with Prettier and then write it to `src/stylis.min.js`.  # Thanks  Stylis was written by [Sultan Tarimo](https://github.com/thysultan). ❤️"

See [`old` and `modern` mode](#old-and-modern-mode). * :link: Can safely work with broken symbolic links.  ## Install  ```console npm install @nodelib/fs.scandir ```  ## Usage  ```ts import * as fsScandir from '@nodelib/fs.scandir';  fsScandir.scandir('path', (error, stats) => { /* … */ }); ```  ## API  ### .scandir(path, [optionsOrSettings], callback)  Returns an array of plain objects ([`Entry`](#entry)) with information about entry for provided path with standard callback-style.  ```ts fsScandir.scandir('path', (error, entries) => { /* … */ }); fsScandir.scandir('path', {}, (error, entries) => { /* … */ }); fsScandir.scandir('path', new fsScandir.Settings(), (error, entries) => { /* … */ }); ```  ### .scandirSync(path, [optionsOrSettings])  Returns an array of plain objects ([`Entry`](#entry)) with information about entry for provided path.  ```ts const entries = fsScandir.scandirSync('path'); const entries = fsScandir.scandirSync('path', {}); const entries = fsScandir.scandirSync(('path', new fsScandir.Settings()); ```  #### path  * Required: `true` * Type: `string | Buffer | URL`  A path to a file. If a URL is provided, it must use the `file:` protocol.  #### optionsOrSettings  * Required: `false` * Type: `Options | Settings` * Default: An instance of `Settings` class  An [`Options`](#options) object or an instance of [`Settings`](#settingsoptions) class.  > :book: When you pass a plain object, an instance of the `Settings` class will be created automatically.

Call `fs.stat` on symbolic link if `true`.  ### `throwErrorOnBrokenSymbolicLink`  * Type: `boolean` * Default: `true`  Throw an error when symbolic link is broken if `true` or safely use `lstat` call if `false`.  ### `pathSegmentSeparator`  * Type: `string` * Default: `path.sep`  By default, this package uses the correct path separator for your OS (`\` on Windows, `/` on Unix-like systems). But you can set this option to any separator character(s) that you want to use instead.  ### `fs`  * Type: [`FileSystemAdapter`](./src/adapters/fs.ts) * Default: A default FS methods  By default, the built-in Node.js module (`fs`) is used to work with the file system.

An additional call for symbolic links (`fs.stat`) is still present.  This mode makes fewer calls to the file system. It's faster.  ## Changelog  See the [Releases section of our GitHub project](https://github.com/nodelib/nodelib/releases) for changelog for each release version.  ## License  This software is released under the terms of the MIT license."

'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of    the copyright owner.

'Contributor' shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and    subsequently incorporated within the Work.  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate    as of the date such litigation is filed.  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You    meet the following conditions:     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices        stating that You changed the files; and     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of        the Derivative Works; and     (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed        as modifying the License.     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with    the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner.

Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"assert-plus@1.0.0","MIT","https://github.com/mcavage/node-assert-plus","# assert-plus  This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like `assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks like this:  ```javascript     var assert = require('assert-plus');      function fooAccount(options, callback) {         assert.object(options, 'options');         assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');         assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');         assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');         assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');         assert.func(callback, 'callback');          // Do stuff         callback(null, {});     } ```  # API  All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError` will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:      AssertionError: foo (string) is required     at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)     at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)     at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)     at Object..js (module.js:464:10)     at Module.load (module.js:353:31)     at Function._load (module.js:311:12)     at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)     at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)  from:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.string(foo, 'foo');     } ```  There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');     } ```  You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):  ```javascript     assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo'); ```  Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from the `assert` module avoids this behavior.  The complete list of APIs is:  * assert.array * assert.bool * assert.buffer * assert.func * assert.number * assert.finite * assert.object * assert.string * assert.stream * assert.date * assert.regexp * assert.uuid * assert.arrayOfArray * assert.arrayOfBool * assert.arrayOfBuffer * assert.arrayOfFunc * assert.arrayOfNumber * assert.arrayOfFinite * assert.arrayOfObject * assert.arrayOfString * assert.arrayOfStream * assert.arrayOfDate * assert.arrayOfRegexp * assert.arrayOfUuid * assert.optionalArray * assert.optionalBool * assert.optionalBuffer * assert.optionalFunc * assert.optionalNumber * assert.optionalFinite * assert.optionalObject * assert.optionalString * assert.optionalStream * assert.optionalDate * assert.optionalRegexp * assert.optionalUuid * assert.optionalArrayOfArray * assert.optionalArrayOfBool * assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer * assert.optionalArrayOfFunc * assert.optionalArrayOfNumber * assert.optionalArrayOfFinite * assert.optionalArrayOfObject * assert.optionalArrayOfString * assert.optionalArrayOfStream * assert.optionalArrayOfDate * assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp * assert.optionalArrayOfUuid * assert.AssertionError * assert.fail * assert.ok * assert.equal * assert.notEqual * assert.deepEqual * assert.notDeepEqual * assert.strictEqual * assert.notStrictEqual * assert.throws * assert.doesNotThrow * assert.ifError  # Installation      npm install assert-plus  ## License  The MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"ast-types-flow@0.0.7","ISC","https://github.com/kyldvs/ast-types-flow","# ast-types-flow  Flow types for the Javascript AST. Based off of [benjamn/ast-types](https://github.com/benjamn/ast-types).  ## Usage  First install `ast-types-flow` via npm, then you can import any of the types that are exported.  ```javascript /* @flow */  import type {Node} from 'ast-types-flow';  function getName(node: Node): string {   switch (node.type) {     case 'Identifier':       return node.name;      case 'ClassDeclaration':       return node.id.name; // Error, id could be null.      case 'FunctionDeclaration':       return node.id.name; // Fine if it's always there.      case 'FunctionExpression':       if (node.id) {         return node.id.name; // Can refine id to make sure it exists.       } else {         return 'Unknown';       }      case 'Literal':       return node.name; // Error, Literals don't have names, don't be silly.   }   return 'Unknown'; } ```  ## How it works  A notion of 'extends' is added to the Flow syntax via comments. A transform is included that will compile the source code into useful disjoint union types based on how the different types extend each other. For example:  ```javascript type Node = {   common: string, };  type Foo = {   // extends Node   foo: string, };  type Bar = {   // extends Node   bar: number, }; ```  Will be transformed into:  ```javascript type Node = {   type: 'Foo',   _Foo: void,   common: string,   foo: string, } | {   type: 'Bar',   _Bar: void,   common: string,   bar: number, };  type Foo = {   type: 'Foo',   _Foo: void,   common: string,   foo: string, };  type Bar = {   type: 'Bar',   _Foo: void,   common: string,   bar: number, }; ```  A few things to note:  1. The type `Node` would more ideally be compiled into `Foo | Bar` but then the disjoint union cannot be properly refined. For now we have to duplicate the complete definitions. 2. Each entry in a disjoint union has to be structurally unique or Flow will have an error on the definition. That is why the private `_Foo: void` fields appear in the types."

This option enables the following:  - Automatically adds the `label` property to styles so that class names   generated by `css` or `styled` include the name of the variable the result is   assigned to. - Please note that non word characters in the variable will be removed   (Eg. `iconStyles$1` will become `iconStyles1`) because `$` is not valid   [CSS ClassName Selector](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448981/which-characters-are-valid-in-css-class-names-selectors#449000)  #### css  **In**  ```javascript const brownStyles = css({ color: 'brown' }) ```  **Out**  ```javascript const brownStyles = /*#__PURE__*/ css({ color: 'brown' }, 'label:brownStyles;') ```  `brownStyles`'s value would be `css-1q8eu9e-brownStyles`  ### `labelFormat`  `string`, defaults to `'[local]'`.  This option only works when `autoLabel` is set to `true`. It allows you to define the format of the resulting `label`. The format is defined via string where variable parts are enclosed in square brackets `[]`. For example `labelFormat: 'my-classname--[local]'`, where `[local]` will be replaced with the name of the variable the result is assigned to.  Allowed values:  - `[local]` - the name of the variable the result of the `css` or `styled` expression is assigned to. - `[filename]` - name of the file (without extension) where `css` or `styled` expression is located. - `[dirname]` - name of the directory containing the file where `css` or `styled` expression is located.  This format only affects the label property of the expression, meaning that the `css` prefix and hash will be prepended automatically.  #### css  **In**  ```javascript // BrownView.js // autoLabel: true // labelFormat: [filename]--[local] const brownStyles = css({ color: 'brown' }) ```  **Out**  ```javascript const brownStyles = /*#__PURE__*/ css(   { color: 'brown' },   'label:BrownView--brownStyles;' ) ```  `BrownView--brownStyles`'s value would be `css-hash-BrownView--brownStyles`  #### styled  **In**  ```javascript const H1 = styled.h1({   borderRadius: '50%',   transition: 'transform 400ms ease-in-out',   boxSizing: 'border-box',   display: 'flex',   ':hover': {     transform: 'scale(1.2)'   } }) ```  **Out**  ```javascript const H1 = /*#__PURE__*/ styled('h1', {   label: 'H1' })({   borderRadius: '50%',   transition: 'transform 400ms ease-in-out',   boxSizing: 'border-box',   display: 'flex',   ':hover': {     transform: 'scale(1.2)'   } }) ```  `H1`'s class name attribute would be `css-hash-H1`  ### `instances`  `Array<string>`, defaults to  ```jsx ;['emotion'] ```  This option allows `babel-plugin-emotion` to know which imports to treat as emotion imports and transform as such. This option is **only** required if you use a custom instance of emotion created with `create-emotion` or you're importing emotion from somewhere other than the paths above. Relative paths are resolved relative to `process.cwd()`(the current working directory).  [**Documentation**](https://emotion.sh/docs/instances)  ### `cssPropOptimization`  `boolean`, defaults to `true`.  This option assumes that you are using something to make `@emotion/core`'s `jsx` function work for all jsx. If you are not doing so and you do not want such optimizations to occur, disable this option.  ## Babel Macros  Instead of using `babel-plugin-emotion`, you can use emotion with [`babel-plugin-macros`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros). Add `babel-plugin-macros` to your babel config (which is included in Create React App 2.0) and use the imports/packages shown below.  ```jsx import styled from 'react-emotion/macro' import { css, keyframes, injectGlobal, flush, hydrate } from 'emotion/macro' import css from '@emotion/css/macro' import styled from '@emotion/styled/macro' ```"

"bn.js@4.11.8","MIT","https://github.com/indutny/bn.js","# <img src='./logo.png' alt='bn.js' width='160' height='160' />  > BigNum in pure javascript  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js)  ## Install `npm install --save bn.js`  ## Usage  ```js const BN = require('bn.js');  var a = new BN('dead', 16); var b = new BN('101010', 2);  var res = a.add(b); console.log(res.toString(10));  // 57047 ```  **Note**: decimals are not supported in this library.  ## Notation  ### Prefixes  There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work. Here is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:  * `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on   which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs * `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or   always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations   like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be   added to the result to make it positive  ### Postfixes  The only available postfix at the moment is:  * `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript   Number. Decimals are not supported.  ### Examples  * `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a` * `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value * `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13  ## Instructions  Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).  ### Utilities  * `a.clone()` - clone number * `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes * `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits) * `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`) * `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero   pad to length, throwing if already exceeding * `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,   which must behave like an `Array` * `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For   compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:   `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)` * `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied * `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits   (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits) * `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied * `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative * `a.isEven()` - no comments * `a.isOdd()` - no comments * `a.isZero()` - no comments * `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)   depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`) * `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`) * `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`) * `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`) * `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`) * `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`) * `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width * `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width * `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance  ### Arithmetics  * `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`) * `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`) * `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.sqr()` - square (`i`) * `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b` * `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`) * `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`) * `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division  ### Bit operations  * `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced   with `andn` in future) * `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1` * `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set * `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`) * `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number * `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)  ### Reduction  * `a.gcd(b)` - GCD * `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`) * `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`  ## Fast reduction  When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm for [Mersenne Prime][1].  ### Reduction context  To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:  ```js var red = BN.red(num); ``` where `num` is just a BN instance.  Or:  ```js var red = BN.red(primeName); ```  Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:  * `'k256'` * `'p224'` * `'p192'` * `'p25519'`  Or:  ```js var red = BN.mont(num); ```  To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than `.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.  ### Converting numbers  Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted to it. Usually, this means that one should:  * Convert inputs to reducted ones * Operate on them in reduction context * Convert outputs back from the reduction context  Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:  ```js var redA = a.toRed(red); ``` Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above  Here is how to convert them back:  ```js var a = redA.fromRed(); ```  ### Red instructions  Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their counterparts in red context:  * `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)` * `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)` * `a.redShl(num)` * `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)` * `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()` * `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime * `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number * `a.redNeg()` * `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation  ## LICENSE  This software is licensed under the MIT License.

"boolbase@1.0.0","ISC","https://github.com/fb55/boolbase","#boolbase This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).  ###WTF?  By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.  ###And why is this a separate module?  I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem."

"bser@2.1.0","Apache-2.0","https://github.com/facebook/watchman","# BSER Binary Serialization  BSER is a binary serialization scheme that can be used as an alternative to JSON. BSER uses a framed encoding that makes it simpler to use to stream a sequence of encoded values.  It is intended to be used for local-IPC only and strings are represented as binary with no specific encoding; this matches the convention employed by most operating system filename storage.  For more details about the serialization scheme see [Watchman's docs](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/bser.html).  ## API  ```js var bser = require('bser'); ```  ### bser.loadFromBuffer  The is the synchronous decoder; given an input string or buffer, decodes a single value and returns it.  Throws an error if the input is invalid.  ```js var obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf); ```  ### bser.dumpToBuffer  Synchronously encodes a value as BSER.  ```js var encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']); console.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello'] ```  ### BunserBuf  The asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object. You may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the decoded values via its `value` event.  ```js var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();  bunser.on('value', function(obj) {   console.log(obj); }); ```  Then in your socket `data` event:  ```js bunser.append(buf); ```  ## Example  Read BSER from socket:  ```js var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();  bunser.on('value', function(obj) {   console.log('data from socket', obj); });  var socket = net.connect('/socket');  socket.on('data', function(buf) {   bunser.append(buf); }); ```  Write BSER to socket:  ```js socket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj)); ```"

Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an 'as-is' basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.  Using Creative Commons Public Licenses  Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.       Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are      intended for use by those authorized to give the public      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-      licensed material, or material used under an exception or      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors: 	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors       Considerations for the public: By using one of our public      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of      the licensed material may still be restricted for other      reasons, including because others have copyright or other      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations      for the public:  	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees  =======================================================================  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License  By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ('Public License'). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.   Section 1 -- Definitions.    a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar      Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material      and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,      arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring      permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the      Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed      Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,      Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is      synched in timed relation with a moving image.    b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright      and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in      accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.    c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights      closely related to copyright including, without limitation,      performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database      Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or      categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights      specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar      Rights.    d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright      Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international      agreements.    e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or      any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights      that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.    f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,      or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public      License.    g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the      terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to      all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the      Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.    h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights      under this Public License.    i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or      process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such      as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,      dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material      available to the public including in ways that members of the      public may access the material from a place and at a time      individually chosen by them.    j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of      the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,      as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.    k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.   Section 2 -- Scope.    a. License grant.         1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:              a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or                in part; and              b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.         2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with           its terms and conditions.         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section           6(a).         4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)           (4) never produces Adapted Material.         5. Downstream recipients.              a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this                Public License.              b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed                Material.         6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).    b. Other rights.         1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed           Rights, but not otherwise.         2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this           Public License.         3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly           reserves any right to collect such royalties.   Section 3 -- License Conditions.  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.    a. Attribution.         1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified           form), You must:              a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor                with the Licensed Material:                   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed                     Material and any others designated to receive                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if                     designated);                  ii. a copyright notice;                 iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;                  iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of                     warranties;                   v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the                     extent reasonably practicable;              b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and              c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or                hyperlink to, this Public License.         2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required           information.         3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent           reasonably practicable.         4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's           License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted           Material from complying with this Public License.   Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial      portion of the contents of the database;    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.   Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.    a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.    b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and      waiver of all liability.   Section 6 -- Term and Termination.    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License      terminate automatically.    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under      Section 6(a), it reinstates:         1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the           violation; or         2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.       For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations      of this Public License.    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so      will not terminate this Public License.    d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public      License.   Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.   Section 8 -- Interpretation.    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully      be made without permission under this Public License.    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and      conditions.    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the      Licensor.    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.   =======================================================================  Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

"change-emitter@0.1.6","MIT","https://github.com/acdlite/change-emitter","change-emitter ==============  [![build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/acdlite/change-emitter/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/acdlite/change-emitter) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/change-emitter.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/change-emitter)  Listen for changes. Like an event emitter that only emits a single event type. Really tiny.  I extracted this from Redux's `createStore()` because I found it to be useful in other contexts. Use it where you want the most minimal event subscription implementation possible.  ## Usage  ```js import { createChangeEmitter } from 'change-emitter'  const emitter = createChangeEmitter()  // Called `listen` instead of `subscribe` to avoid confusion with observable spec const unlisten = emitter.listen((...args) => {   console.log(args) })  emitter.emit(1, 2, 3) // logs `[1, 2, 3]` unlisten() emitter.emit(4, 5, 6) // doesn't log ```  ## Larger example  Here's a (partial) implementation of Redux's `createStore`:  ```js const createStore = (reducer, initialState) => {   let state = initialState   const emitter = createChangeEmitter()    function dispatch(action) {     state = reducer(state, action)     emitter.emit()     return action   }    function getState() {     return state   }    return {     dispatch,     getState,     subscribe: emitter.listen   } } ```"

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)  ## Why? Node.js `fs.watch`:  * Doesn't report filenames on MacOS. * Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS. * Often reports events twice. * Emits most changes as `rename`. * Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues) * Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.  Node.js `fs.watchFile`:  * Almost as bad at event handling. * Also does not provide any recursive watching. * Results in high CPU utilization.  Chokidar resolves these problems.  Initially made for **[Brunch](http://brunch.io)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/), [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io), [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2), [browserify](http://browserify.org/), [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/), [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/). It has proven itself in production environments.  ## How? Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using `fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.  On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin `FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.  On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much more than needed.  ## Getting started Install with npm:  ```sh npm install chokidar ```  Then `require` and use it in your code:  ```javascript var chokidar = require('chokidar');  // One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles chokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {   console.log(event, path); }); ```  ```javascript // Example of a more typical implementation structure:  // Initialize watcher. var watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {   ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,   persistent: true });  // Something to use when events are received. var log = console.log.bind(console); // Add event listeners. watcher   .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))   .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))   .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));  // More possible events. watcher   .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))   .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))   .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))   .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))   .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {     log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);   });  // 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second // argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats watcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {   if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`); });  // Watch new files. watcher.add('new-file'); watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);  // Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();  // Un-watch some files. watcher.unwatch('new-file*');  // Stop watching. watcher.close();  // Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example) chokidar.watch('file', {   persistent: true,    ignored: '*.txt',   ignoreInitial: false,   followSymlinks: true,   cwd: '.',   disableGlobbing: false,    usePolling: true,   interval: 100,   binaryInterval: 300,   alwaysStat: false,   depth: 99,   awaitWriteFinish: {     stabilityThreshold: 2000,     pollInterval: 100   },    ignorePermissionErrors: false,   atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100) });  ```  ## API  `chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`  * `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched recursively, or glob patterns. * `options` (object) Options object as defined below:  #### Persistence  * `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to `false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.  #### Path filtering  * `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition) Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second time with two arguments (the path and the [`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) object of that path). * `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event). * `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following the link references and bubbling events through the link's path. * `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this. * `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as literal path names, even if they look like globs.  #### Performance  * `usePolling` (default: `false`). Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the `useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option. * _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)   * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also     set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.   * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system   polling for binary files.   ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json)) * `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the `fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default. * `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the [`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't already available from the underlying watch events. * `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of subdirectories will be traversed. * `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`). By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change` events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases, especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification. Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size, holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive. Use with caution.   * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust   timing params:*   * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in   milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.   * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.  #### Errors * `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM` or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently. * `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`). Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use 'atomic writes' instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in milliseconds.  ### Methods & Events  `chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:  * `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking. Takes an array of strings or just one string. * `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event. Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`, `raw`, `error`. Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`. * `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns. Takes an array of strings or just one string. * `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files. * `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.  ## CLI  If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out [chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.  ## Install Troubleshooting  * `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`   * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is     not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,     Chokidar should function properly.  * `ERR! stack Error: Python executable 'python' is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`   * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:     `npm config set python python2.7`  * `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`   * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools  ## License  The MIT License (MIT)  Copyright (c) 2012-2019 Paul Miller (https://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"clipboard@2.0.4","MIT","https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js","# clipboard.js  [![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/zenorocha/clipboard.js/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/zenorocha/clipboard.js) ![Killing Flash](https://img.shields.io/badge/killing-flash-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)  > Modern copy to clipboard. No Flash. Just 3kb gzipped.  <a href='https://clipboardjs.com/'><img width='728' src='https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/16165747/a0f6fc46-349a-11e6-8c9b-c5fd58d9099c.png' alt='Demo'></a>  ## Why  Copying text to the clipboard shouldn't be hard. It shouldn't require dozens of steps to configure or hundreds of KBs to load. But most of all, it shouldn't depend on Flash or any bloated framework.  That's why clipboard.js exists.  ## Install  You can get it on npm.  ``` npm install clipboard --save ```  Or if you're not into package management, just [download a ZIP](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/archive/master.zip) file.  ## Setup  First, include the script located on the `dist` folder or load it from [a third-party CDN provider](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/wiki/CDN-Providers).  ```html <script src='dist/clipboard.min.js'></script> ```  Now, you need to instantiate it by [passing a DOM selector](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/blob/master/demo/constructor-selector.html#L18), [HTML element](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/blob/master/demo/constructor-node.html#L16-L17), or [list of HTML elements](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/blob/master/demo/constructor-nodelist.html#L18-L19).  ```js new ClipboardJS('.btn'); ```  Internally, we need to fetch all elements that matches with your selector and attach event listeners for each one. But guess what? If you have hundreds of matches, this operation can consume a lot of memory.  For this reason we use [event delegation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1687296/what-is-dom-event-delegation) which replaces multiple event listeners with just a single listener. After all, [#perfmatters](https://twitter.com/hashtag/perfmatters).  # Usage  We're living a _declarative renaissance_, that's why we decided to take advantage of [HTML5 data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes) for better usability.  ### Copy text from another element  A pretty common use case is to copy content from another element. You can do that by adding a `data-clipboard-target` attribute in your trigger element.  The value you include on this attribute needs to match another's element selector.  <a href='https://clipboardjs.com/#example-target'><img width='473' alt='example-2' src='https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/9983467/a4946aaa-5fb1-11e5-9780-f09fcd7ca6c8.png'></a>  ```html <!-- Target --> <input id='foo' value='https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js.git'>  <!-- Trigger --> <button class='btn' data-clipboard-target='#foo'>     <img src='assets/clippy.svg' alt='Copy to clipboard'> </button> ```  ### Cut text from another element  Additionally, you can define a `data-clipboard-action` attribute to specify if you want to either `copy` or `cut` content.  If you omit this attribute, `copy` will be used by default.  <a href='https://clipboardjs.com/#example-action'><img width='473' alt='example-3' src='https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/10000358/7df57b9c-6050-11e5-9cd1-fbc51d2fd0a7.png'></a>  ```html <!-- Target --> <textarea id='bar'>Mussum ipsum cacilds...</textarea>  <!-- Trigger --> <button class='btn' data-clipboard-action='cut' data-clipboard-target='#bar'>     Cut to clipboard </button> ```  As you may expect, the `cut` action only works on `<input>` or `<textarea>` elements.  ### Copy text from attribute  Truth is, you don't even need another element to copy its content from. You can just include a `data-clipboard-text` attribute in your trigger element.  <a href='https://clipboardjs.com/#example-text'><img width='147' alt='example-1' src='https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/10000347/6e16cf8c-6050-11e5-9883-1c5681f9ec45.png'></a>  ```html <!-- Trigger --> <button class='btn' data-clipboard-text='Just because you can doesn't mean you should — clipboard.js'>     Copy to clipboard </button> ```  ## Events  There are cases where you'd like to show some user feedback or capture what has been selected after a copy/cut operation.  That's why we fire custom events such as `success` and `error` for you to listen and implement your custom logic.  ```js var clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn');  clipboard.on('success', function(e) {     console.info('Action:', e.action);     console.info('Text:', e.text);     console.info('Trigger:', e.trigger);      e.clearSelection(); });  clipboard.on('error', function(e) {     console.error('Action:', e.action);     console.error('Trigger:', e.trigger); }); ```  For a live demonstration, go to this [site](https://clipboardjs.com/) and open your console.  ## Tooltips  Each application has different design needs, that's why clipboard.js does not include any CSS or built-in tooltip solution.  The tooltips you see on the [demo site](https://clipboardjs.com/) were built using [GitHub's Primer](https://github.com/primer/primer-css/tree/master/modules/primer-tooltips). You may want to check that out if you're looking for a similar look and feel.  ## Advanced Options  If you don't want to modify your HTML, there's a pretty handy imperative API for you to use. All you need to do is declare a function, do your thing, and return a value.  For instance, if you want to dynamically set a `target`, you'll need to return a Node.  ```js new ClipboardJS('.btn', {     target: function(trigger) {         return trigger.nextElementSibling;     } }); ```  If you want to dynamically set a `text`, you'll return a String.  ```js new ClipboardJS('.btn', {     text: function(trigger) {         return trigger.getAttribute('aria-label');     } }); ```  For use in Bootstrap Modals or with any other library that changes the focus you'll want to set the focused element as the `container` value.  ```js new ClipboardJS('.btn', {     container: document.getElementById('modal') }); ```  Also, if you are working with single page apps, you may want to manage the lifecycle of the DOM more precisely. Here's how you clean up the events and objects that we create.  ```js var clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn'); clipboard.destroy(); ```  ## Browser Support  This library relies on both [Selection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection) and [execCommand](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand) APIs. The first one is [supported by all browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=selection) while the second one is supported in the following browsers.  | <img src='https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/chrome.png' width='48px' height='48px' alt='Chrome logo'> | <img src='https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/edge.png' width='48px' height='48px' alt='Edge logo'> | <img src='https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/firefox.png' width='48px' height='48px' alt='Firefox logo'> | <img src='https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/ie.png' width='48px' height='48px' alt='Internet Explorer logo'> | <img src='https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/opera.png' width='48px' height='48px' alt='Opera logo'> | <img src='https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/safari.png' width='48px' height='48px' alt='Safari logo'> | |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| | 42+ ✔ | 12+ ✔ | 41+ ✔ | 9+ ✔ | 29+ ✔ | 10+ ✔ |  The good news is that clipboard.js gracefully degrades if you need to support older browsers. All you have to do is show a tooltip saying `Copied!` when `success` event is called and `Press Ctrl+C to copy` when `error` event is called because the text is already selected.  You can also check if clipboard.js is supported or not by running `ClipboardJS.isSupported()`, that way you can hide copy/cut buttons from the UI.  ## Bonus  A browser extension that adds a 'copy to clipboard' button to every code block on *GitHub, MDN, Gist, StackOverflow, StackExchange, npm, and even Medium.*  Install for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecopy/fkbfebkcoelajmhanocgppanfoojcdmg) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codecopy/).  ## License  [MIT License](http://zenorocha.mit-license.org/) © Zeno Rocha"

"corejs-upgrade-webpack-plugin@2.2.0","MIT","https://github.com/ndelangen/corejs-upgrade-webpack-plugin","# CoreJS Upgrade Webpack Plugin  I wrote this to ensure the latest version of core-js is used everywhere in an application.  Sometimes you're depending on components or libraries that haven't updated yet, and this can increase bundle-size, or even break your app if these dependencies didn't have core-js as a dependency themselves.  This Webpack Plugin will essentially do a search and replace on all requires and if the require path matches `/core-js/` it will try and resolve the require. If it can, nothing happens. If the resolve fails (this would normally break your app) this plugin tries to map the old core-js path to the new path structure, and resolve that instead.  This plugin will allow you to specify a `resolveFrom` option, so you can resolve core-js from any path you'd like. This is useful if you know there are going to be multiple core-js version installed, and you want to pick a specific one installed somewhere.  ## Install  ```sh yarn add corejs-upgrade-webpack-plugin ```  ## Usage  simple example:  ```js import CoreJSUpgradeWebpackPlugin from 'corejs-upgrade-webpack-plugin';  // add this to your webpack.plugins config new CoreJSUpgradeWebpackPlugin(); ```  example with options:  ```js import CoreJSUpgradeWebpackPlugin from 'corejs-upgrade-webpack-plugin';  // add this to your webpack.plugins config new CoreJSUpgradeWebpackPlugin({   resolveFrom: process.cwd(), }); ```"

"cssstyle@1.4.0","MIT","https://github.com/jsakas/CSSStyleDeclaration","# CSSStyleDeclaration  [![NpmVersion](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cssstyle.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cssstyle) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsakas/CSSStyleDeclaration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsakas/CSSStyleDeclaration)  CSSStyleDeclaration is a work-a-like to the CSSStyleDeclaration class in Nikita Vasilyev's [CSSOM](https://github.com/NV/CSSOM). I made it so that when using [jQuery in node](https://github.com/tmtk75/node-jquery) setting css attributes via $.fn.css() would work. node-jquery uses [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) to create a DOM to use in node. jsdom uses CSSOM for styling, and CSSOM's implementation of the [CSSStyleDeclaration](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSSStyleDeclaration) doesn't support [CSS2Properties](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties), which is how jQuery's [$.fn.css()](http://api.jquery.com/css/) operates.  ### Why not just issue a pull request?  Well, NV wants to keep CSSOM fast (which I can appreciate) and CSS2Properties aren't required by the standard (though every browser has the interface). So I figured the path of least resistance would be to just modify this one class, publish it as a node module (that requires CSSOM) and then make a pull request of jsdom to use it.  ### How do I test this code?  `npm test` should do the trick, assuming you have the dev dependencies installed:  ``` $ npm test  tests ✔ Verify Has Properties ✔ Verify Has Functions ✔ Verify Has Special Properties ✔ Test From Style String ✔ Test From Properties ✔ Test Shorthand Properties ✔ Test width and height Properties and null and empty strings ✔ Test Implicit Properties ```"

"cyclist@0.2.2","MIT*","https://github.com/mafintosh/cyclist","# Cyclist  Cyclist is an efficient [cyclic list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) implemention for Javascript. It is available through npm  	npm install cyclist  ## What?  Cyclist allows you to create a list of fixed size that is cyclic. In a cyclist list the element following the last one is the first one. This property can be really useful when for example trying to order data packets that can arrive out of order over a network stream.  ## Usage  ``` js var cyclist = require('cyclist'); var list = cyclist(4); // if size (4) is not a power of 2 it will be the follwing power of 2                        // this buffer can now hold 4 elements in total  list.put(42, 'hello 42'); // store something and index 42 list.put(43, 'hello 43'); // store something and index 43  console.log(list.get(42)); // prints hello 42 console.log(list.get(46)); // prints hello 42 again since 46 - 42 == list.size ```  ## API  * `cyclist(size)` creates a new buffer * `cyclist#get(index)` get an object stored in the buffer * `cyclist#put(index,value)` insert an object into the buffer * `cyclist#del(index)` delete an object from an index * `cyclist#size` property containing current size of buffer  ## License  MIT"

Most of the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.  All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is provided by [hash.js][2]  ### Related projects  * [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both   browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for   node)  #### LICENSE  This software is licensed under the MIT License.

"emotion-theming@10.0.14","MIT","https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/tree/master/packages/emotion-theming","# emotion-theming  > A CSS-in-JS theming solution for React  _`emotion-theming` is a theming library inspired by [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)_  ## Table of Contents  - [Install](#install) - [Usage](#usage) - [API](#api)   - [ThemeProvider](#themeprovider-reactcomponenttype)   - [withTheme](#withthemecomponent-reactcomponenttype-reactcomponenttype) - [Credits](#credits) - [License](#license)  ## Install  ```bash # add --save if using npm@4 or lower npm i emotion-theming  # or yarn add emotion-theming ```  ## Usage  Theming is accomplished by placing the `ThemeProvider` component, at the top of the React component tree and wrapping descendants with the `withTheme` higher-order component. This HOC gets the current theme and injects it as a 'prop' into your own component.  The theme prop is automatically injected into components created with `styled`. The theme can also be accessed via passing a function to the css prop.  ```jsx // Page.js import * as React from 'react' /** @jsx jsx */ import { jsx } from '@emotion/core' import styled from '@emotion/styled'  const Container = styled.div({   background: 'whitesmoke',   height: '100vh' })  const Headline = styled.h1`   color: ${props => props.theme.color};   font-family: sans-serif; `  export default class Page extends React.Component {   render() {     return (       <Container>         <Headline>I'm red!</Headline>         <p css={theme => ({ color: theme.color })}>I'm also red!</p>       </Container>     )   } }  // App.js import React from 'react' import ReactDOM from 'react-dom' import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming'  import Page from './Page.js'  const theme = {   color: 'red' }  class App extends React.Component {   render() {     return (       <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>         <Page />       </ThemeProvider>     )   } } ```  ## API  ### ThemeProvider: React.ComponentType  A React component that passes the theme object down the component tree via [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). Additional `ThemeProvider` components can be added deeper in the tree to override the original theme. The theme object will be merged into its ancestor as if by [`Object.assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign). If a function is passed instead of an object it will be called with the ancestor theme and the result will be the new theme.  _Accepts:_  - **`children`: React.Node** - **`theme`: Object|Object => Object** - An object or function that provides an object.  ```jsx import React from 'react' import styled from '@emotion/styled' import { ThemeProvider, withTheme } from 'emotion-theming'  // object-style theme  const theme = {   backgroundColor: 'green',   color: 'red' }  // function-style theme; note that if multiple <ThemeProvider> are used, // the parent theme will be passed as a function argument  const adjustedTheme = ancestorTheme => ({ ...ancestorTheme, color: 'blue' })  class Container extends React.Component {   render() {     return (       <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>         <ThemeProvider theme={adjustedTheme}>           <Text>Boom shaka laka!</Text>         </ThemeProvider>       </ThemeProvider>     )   } } ```  > Note: > > Make sure to hoist your theme out of render otherwise you may have performance problems.  ### withTheme(component: React.ComponentType): React.ComponentType  A higher-order component that provides the current theme as a prop to the wrapped child and listens for changes. If the theme is updated, the child component will be re-rendered accordingly.  ```jsx import PropTypes from 'prop-types' import React from 'react' import { withTheme } from 'emotion-theming'  class TellMeTheColor extends React.Component {   render() {     return <div>The color is {this.props.theme.color}.</div>   } }  TellMeTheColor.propTypes = {   theme: PropTypes.shape({     color: PropTypes.string   }) }  const TellMeTheColorWithTheme = withTheme(TellMeTheColor) ```  ## Credits  Thanks goes to the [styled-components team](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) and [their contributors](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/graphs/contributors) who designed this API.  ## License  MIT 2017-present"

"errno@0.1.7","MIT","https://github.com/rvagg/node-errno","# node-errno  > Better [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)/[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)/[io.js](https://iojs.org) error handling & reporting. Available in npm as *errno*.  [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)  * [errno exposed](#errnoexposed) * [Custom errors](#customerrors)  <a name='errnoexposed'></a> ## errno exposed  Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.  **By errno:**  ```js require('errno').errno[3] // → { //     'errno': 3, //     'code': 'EACCES', //     'description': 'permission denied' //   } ```  **By code:**  ```js require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY // → { //     'errno': 53, //     'code': 'ENOTEMPTY', //     'description': 'directory not empty' //   } ```  **Make your errors more descriptive:**  ```js var errno = require('errno')  function errmsg(err) {   var str = 'Error: '   // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno   if (errno.errno[err.errno])     str += errno.errno[err.errno].description   else     str += err.message    // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property   if (err.path)     str += ' [' + err.path + ']'    return str }  var fs = require('fs')  fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {   if (err)     console.log(errmsg(err)) }) ```  **Use as a command line tool:**  ``` ~ $ errno 53 {   'errno': 53,   'code': 'ENOTEMPTY',   'description': 'directory not empty' } ~ $ errno EROFS {   'errno': 56,   'code': 'EROFS',   'description': 'read-only file system' } ~ $ errno foo No such errno/code: 'foo' ```  Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.  You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.  <a name='customerrors'></a> ## Custom errors  Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.  ```js var create = require('errno').custom.createError var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)  // use them! if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')  if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err)) ```  Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:  ```js fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {   if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))   // do something else }) ```  The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.  ## Contributors  * [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI * [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)  ## Copyright & Licence  *Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*  Made available under the MIT licence:  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks.

"esrecurse@4.2.1","BSD-2-Clause","https://github.com/estools/esrecurse","### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)  Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) recursive traversing functionality.  ### Example Usage  The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(ast, {     XXXStatement: function (node) {         this.visit(node.left);         // do something...         this.visit(node.right);     } }); ```  We can use `Visitor` instance.  ```javascript var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({     XXXStatement: function (node) {         this.visit(node.left);         // do something...         this.visit(node.right);     } });  visitor.visit(ast); ```  We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.  ```javascript class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {     constructor()     {         super(null);     }      XXXStatement(node) {     } } ```  ```javascript function DerivedVisitor() {     esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */); } util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor); DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {     this.visit(node.left);     // do something...     this.visit(node.right); }; ```  And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.  ```javascript function DerivedVisitor() {     esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */); } util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor); DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {     // do something...     this.visitChildren(node); }; ```  The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`. We can use user-defined node types.  ```javascript // This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node. var tree = {     type: 'TestExpression',      // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.     argument: {         type: 'Literal',         value: 20     },      // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.     extended: true }; esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         // Extending the existing traversing rules.         childVisitorKeys: {             // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]             TestExpression: ['argument']         }     } ); ```  We can use the `fallback` option as well. If the `fallback` option is `'iteration'`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes. Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         fallback: 'iteration'     } ); ```  If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes. Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         fallback: function (node) {             return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {                 return key !== 'argument'             });         }     } ); ```  ### License  Copyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)  (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.

"fast-diff@1.2.0","Apache-2.0","https://github.com/jhchen/fast-diff","# Fast Diff [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jhchen/fast-diff.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jhchen/fast-diff)  This is a simplified import of the excellent [diff-match-patch](https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/) library by [Neil Fraser](https://neil.fraser.name/) into the Node.js environment. The match and patch parts are removed, as well as all the extra diff options. What remains is incredibly fast diffing between two strings.   The diff function is an implementation of ['An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations' (Myers, 1986)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.6927&rep=rep1&type=pdf) with the suggested divide and conquer strategy along with several [optimizations](http://neil.fraser.name/news/2007/10/09/) Neil added.  ```js var diff = require('fast-diff');  var good = 'Good dog'; var bad = 'Bad dog';  var result = diff(good, bad); // [[-1, 'Goo'], [1, 'Ba'], [0, 'd dog']]  // Respect suggested edit location (cursor position), added in v1.1 diff('aaa', 'aaaa', 1) // [[0, 'a'], [1, 'a'], [0, 'aa']]  // For convenience diff.INSERT === 1; diff.EQUAL === 0; diff.DELETE === -1; ```"

"fb-watchman@2.0.0","Apache-2.0","https://github.com/facebook/watchman","# fb-watchman  `fb-watchman` is a filesystem watcher that uses the [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) file watching service from Facebook.  Watchman provides file change notification services using very efficient recursive watches and also allows more advanced change matching and filesystem tree querying operations using [a powerful expression syntax](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/file-query.html#expressions).  ## Install  You should [install Watchman]( https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) to make the most of this module.  Then simply:  ``` $ npm install fb-watchman ```  ## Key Concepts  - Watchman recursively watches directories. - Each watched directory is called a `root`. - You must initiate a `watch` on a `root` using the `watch-project` command prior to subscribing to changes - Rather than separately watching many sibling directories, `watch-project` consolidates and re-uses existing watches relative to a project root (the location of your `.watchmanconfig` or source control repository root) - change notifications are relative to the project root  ## How do I use it?  [Read the NodeJS watchman documentation](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/nodejs.html)"

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:  You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and  You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and  You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and  If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

To match bash-like globs, eg. `?` for any single-character match, `[a-z]` for character ranges, and `{*.html, *.js}` for multiple alternatives, call with `{ extended: true }`.  To obey [globstars `**`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) rules set option `{globstar: true}`. NOTE: This changes the behavior of `*` when `globstar` is `true` as shown below: When `{globstar: true}`: `/foo/**` will match any string that starts with `/foo/` like `/foo/index.htm`, `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, etc.  Also, `/foo/**/*.txt` will match any string that starts with `/foo/` and ends with `.txt` like `/foo/bar.txt`, `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, etc. Whereas `/foo/*` (single `*`, not a globstar) will match strings that start with `/foo/` like `/foo/index.htm`, `/foo/baz.txt` but will not match strings that contain a `/` to the right like `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, `/foo/bar/baz/qux.dat`, etc.  Set flags on the resulting `RegExp` object by adding the `flags` property to the option object, eg `{ flags: 'i' }` for ignoring case.  ## Install      npm install glob-to-regexp  ## Usage ```js var globToRegExp = require('glob-to-regexp'); var re = globToRegExp('p*uck'); re.test('pot luck'); // true re.test('pluck'); // true re.test('puck'); // true  re = globToRegExp('*.min.js'); re.test('http://example.com/jquery.min.js'); // true re.test('http://example.com/jquery.min.js.map'); // false  re = globToRegExp('*/www/*.js'); re.test('http://example.com/www/app.js'); // true re.test('http://example.com/www/lib/factory-proxy-model-observer.js'); // true  // Extended globs re = globToRegExp('*/www/{*.js,*.html}', { extended: true }); re.test('http://example.com/www/app.js'); // true re.test('http://example.com/www/index.html'); // true ```  ## License  Copyright (c) 2013, Nick Fitzgerald  All rights reserved.

"growly@1.3.0","MIT","https://github.com/theabraham/growly","# Growly #  Simple zero-dependency Growl notifications using GNTP.  ## Installation ##  Install growly using `npm`:  ``` npm install growly ```  And then require it:  ```javascript var growly = require('growly'); ```  This module uses the Growl Network Transport Protocol (GNTP) which was implemented in Growl since version 1.3, so you **must have an appropriate version of Growl installed** for Growly to work.  ## Example ##  Sending a minimal Growl notification:  ```javascript var growly = require('growly');  growly.notify('This is as easy as it gets', { title: 'Hello, World!' }); ```  More examples can be found in the *example/* directory.  ## Usage ##  The growly module exposes only three methods: `Growly.register()`, `Growly.notify()`, and `Growly.setHost()`.  ### Growly.register(appname, [appicon], [notifications], [callback]) ###  Registers a new application with Growl. Registration is completely optional since it will be performed automatically for you with sensible defaults. Useful if you want your application, with its own icon and types of notifications, to show up in Growl's prefence panel.    - `appname` the name of the application (required.)   - `appicon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for an application icon image.   - `notifications` a list of defined notification types with the following properties:     - `.label` name used to identify the type of notification being used (required.)     - `.dispname` name users will see in Growl's preference panel (defaults to `.label`.)     - `.enabled` whether or not notifications of this type are enabled (defaults to true.)   - `callback` called when the registration completes; if registration fails, the first argument will be an Error object.  An example:  ```javascript growly.register('My Application', 'path/to/icon.png', [     { label: 'success', dispname: 'Success' },     { label: 'warning', dispname: 'Warning', enabled: false } ], function(err) {     console.log(err || 'Registration successful!'); }); ```  ### Growly.notify(text, [opts], [callback]) ###  Sends a Growl notification. If an application wasn't registered beforehand with `growly.register()`, a default application will automatically be registered beforesending the notification.    - `text` the body of the notification.   - `opts` an object with the following properties:     - `.title` title of the notification.     - `.icon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for the notification's icon.     - `.sticky` whether or not to sticky the notification (defaults to false.)     - `.label` type of notification to use (defaults to the first registered notification type.)     - `.priority` the priority of the notification from lowest (-2) to highest (2).     - `.coalescingId` replace/update the matching previous notification. May be ignored.   - `callback` called when the user has closed/clicked the notification. The callback is passed an Error object `err` as the first argument when the notification fails; otherwise, the second argument `action` is a string that'll describe which action has been taken by the user (either 'closed' or 'clicked'.)  An example:  ```javascript /* Assuming an application was registered with a notification type labeled 'warning'. */ growly.notify('Stuffs broken!', { label: 'warning' }, function(err, action) {     console.log('Action:', action); }); ```  ### Growly.setHost(host, port) ###  Set the host and port that Growl (GNTP) requests will be sent to. Using this method is optional since GNTP defaults to using host 'localhost' and port 23053.  ## License ##  Copyright (C) 2014 Ibrahim Al-Rajhi <abrahamalrajhi@gmail.com>  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"gud@1.0.0","MIT","https://github.com/jamiebuilds/global-unique-id","# gud  > Create a 'gud nuff' (not cryptographically secure) globally unique id  ## Install  ``` yarn add gud ```  ## Usage  ```js const gud = require('gud');  console.log(gud()); // 1 console.log(gud()); // 2 ```  This is ever so slightly better than using something like `_.uniqueId` because it will work across multiple copies of the same module.  Do not use this in place of actual UUIDs, security folks will hate me.  This will not be unique across processes/workers."

This is broken into its own module in case the behaviour needs to be replicated in other PostCSS plugins (i.e. [CSS Modules Constants](https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules-constants))  ## API  ```js import replaceSymbols from 'icss-replace-symbols' replaceSymbols(css, translations) ```  Where:  - `css` is the PostCSS tree you're working with - `translations` is an JS object of `symbol: 'replacement'` pairs, where all occurrences of `symbol` are replaced with `replacement`.  ## Behaviour  A symbol is a string of alphanumeric, `-` or `_` characters. A replacement can be any string. They are replaced in the following places:  - In the value of a declaration, i.e. `color: my_symbol;` or `box-shadow: 0 0 blur spread shadow-color` - In a media expression i.e. `@media small {}` or `@media screen and not-large {}`  ## License  ISC  --- Glen Maddern, 2015."

Pay attention that [`minimatch`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/minimatch) does not work in the gitignore way. To filter filenames according to .gitignore file, I recommend this module.  ##### Tested on  - Linux + Node: `0.8` - `7.x` - Windows + Node: `0.10` - `7.x`, node < `0.10` is not tested due to the lack of support of appveyor.  Actually, `ignore` does not rely on any versions of node specially.  ## Table Of Main Contents  - [Usage](#usage) - [Guide for 2.x -> 3.x](#upgrade-2x---3x) - [Contributing](#contributing) - Related Packages   - [`glob-gitignore`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob-gitignore) matches files using patterns and filters them according to gitignore rules.  ## Usage  ```js const ignore = require('ignore') const ig = ignore().add(['.abc/*', '!.abc/d/']) ```  ### Filter the given paths  ```js const paths = [   '.abc/a.js',    // filtered out   '.abc/d/e.js'   // included ]  ig.filter(paths)        // ['.abc/d/e.js'] ig.ignores('.abc/a.js') // true ```  ### As the filter function  ```js paths.filter(ig.createFilter()); // ['.abc/d/e.js'] ```  ### Win32 paths will be handled  ```js ig.filter(['.abc\\a.js', '.abc\\d\\e.js']) // if the code above runs on windows, the result will be // ['.abc\\d\\e.js'] ```  ## Why another ignore?  - `ignore` is a standalone module, and is much simpler so that it could easy work with other programs, unlike [isaacs](https://npmjs.org/~isaacs)'s [fstream-ignore](https://npmjs.org/package/fstream-ignore) which must work with the modules of the fstream family.  - `ignore` only contains utility methods to filter paths according to the specified ignore rules, so   - `ignore` never try to find out ignore rules by traversing directories or fetching from git configurations.   - `ignore` don't cares about sub-modules of git projects.  - Exactly according to [gitignore man page](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), fixes some known matching issues of fstream-ignore, such as:   - '`/*.js`' should only match '`a.js`', but not '`abc/a.js`'.   - '`**/foo`' should match '`foo`' anywhere.   - Prevent re-including a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.   - Handle trailing whitespaces:     - `'a '`(one space) should not match `'a  '`(two spaces).     - `'a \ '` matches `'a  '`   - All test cases are verified with the result of `git check-ignore`.  ## Methods  ### .add(pattern) ### .add(patterns)  - **pattern** `String|Ignore` An ignore pattern string, or the `Ignore` instance - **patterns** `Array.<pattern>` Array of ignore patterns.  Adds a rule or several rules to the current manager.  Returns `this`  Notice that a line starting with `'#'`(hash) is treated as a comment. Put a backslash (`'\'`) in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash, if you want to ignore a file with a hash at the beginning of the filename.  ```js ignore().add('#abc').ignores('#abc')    // false ignore().add('\#abc').ignores('#abc')   // true ```  `pattern` could either be a line of ignore pattern or a string of multiple ignore patterns, which means we could just `ignore().add()` the content of a ignore file:  ```js ignore() .add(fs.readFileSync(filenameOfGitignore).toString()) .filter(filenames) ```  `pattern` could also be an `ignore` instance, so that we could easily inherit the rules of another `Ignore` instance.  ### <strike>.addIgnoreFile(path)</strike>  REMOVED in `3.x` for now.  To upgrade `ignore@2.x` up to `3.x`, use  ```js const fs = require('fs')  if (fs.existsSync(filename)) {   ignore().add(fs.readFileSync(filename).toString()) } ```  instead.   ### .ignores(pathname)  > new in 3.2.0  Returns `Boolean` whether `pathname` should be ignored.  ```js ig.ignores('.abc/a.js')    // true ```  ### .filter(paths)  Filters the given array of pathnames, and returns the filtered array.  - **paths** `Array.<path>` The array of `pathname`s to be filtered.  **NOTICE** that:  - `pathname` should be a string that have been `path.join()`ed, or the return value of `path.relative()` to the current directory.  ```js // WRONG ig.ignores('./abc')  // WRONG, for it will never happen. // If the gitignore rule locates at the root directory, // `'/abc'` should be changed to `'abc'`. // ``` // path.relative('/', '/abc')  -> 'abc' // ``` ig.ignores('/abc')  // Right ig.ignores('abc')  // Right ig.ignores(path.join('./abc'))  // path.join('./abc') -> 'abc' ```  - In other words, each `pathname` here should be a relative path to the directory of the git ignore rules.  Suppose the dir structure is:  ``` /path/to/your/repo     |-- a     |   |-- a.js     |     |-- .b     |     |-- .c          |-- .DS_store ```  Then the `paths` might be like this:  ```js [   'a/a.js'   '.b',   '.c/.DS_store' ] ```  Usually, you could use [`glob`](http://npmjs.org/package/glob) with `option.mark = true` to fetch the structure of the current directory:  ```js const glob = require('glob')  glob('**', {   // Adds a / character to directory matches.   mark: true }, (err, files) => {   if (err) {     return console.error(err)   }    let filtered = ignore().add(patterns).filter(files)   console.log(filtered) }) ```  ### .createFilter()  Creates a filter function which could filter an array of paths with `Array.prototype.filter`.  Returns `function(path)` the filter function.  ****  ## Upgrade 2.x -> 3.x  - All `options` of 2.x are unnecessary and removed, so just remove them. - `ignore()` instance is no longer an [`EventEmitter`](nodejs.org/api/events.html), and all events are unnecessary and removed. - `.addIgnoreFile()` is removed, see the [.addIgnoreFile](#addignorefilepath) section for details.  ****  ## Contributing  The code of `node-ignore` is based on es6 and babel, but babel and its preset is not included in the `dependencies` field of package.json, so that the installation process of test cases will not fail in older versions of node.  So use `bash install.sh` to install dependencies and `bash test.sh` to run test cases in your local machine.  #### Collaborators  - [SamyPesse](https://github.com/SamyPesse) *Samy Pessé* - [azproduction](https://github.com/azproduction) *Mikhail Davydov* - [TrySound](https://github.com/TrySound) *Bogdan Chadkin* - [JanMattner](https://github.com/JanMattner) *Jan Mattner*"

"imurmurhash@0.1.4","MIT","https://github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js","iMurmurHash.js ==============  An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).  This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.  Installation ------------  To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.  ```html <script type='text/javascript' src='/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js'></script> <script> // Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3 </script> ```  ---  To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:  ```bash npm install imurmurhash ```  Then simply include it in your scripts:  ```javascript MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash'); ```  Quick Example -------------  ```javascript // Create the initial hash var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');  // Incrementally add text hashState.hash('more strings'); hashState.hash('even more strings');  // All calls can be chained if desired hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');  // Get a result hashState.result(); // returns 0xe4ccfe6b ```  Functions ---------  ### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed]) Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:  ```javascript // Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same // object (but reset, so the current state would be lost) hashState = MurmurHash3(); ...  // Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the // function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss // will occur, at the cost of creating more objects. hashState = new MurmurHash3(); ```  Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string) Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.result () Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.  ```javascript // Do the whole string at once MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result(); // 0x70529328  // Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part var m = MurmurHash3('this is a'); m.result(); // 0xbfc4f834 m.hash(' test string').result(); // 0x70529328 (same as above) ```  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed]) Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  License (MIT) ------------- Copyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner.

Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

'Patent Claims' of a Contributor     means any patent claim(s), including without limitation, method,     process, and apparatus claims, in any patent Licensable by such     Contributor that would be infringed, but for the grant of the     License, by the making, using, selling, offering for sale, having     made, import, or transfer of either its Contributions or its     Contributor Version.  1.12. 'Secondary License'     means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, the GNU     Lesser General Public License, Version 2.1, the GNU Affero General     Public License, Version 3.0, or any later versions of those     licenses.  1.13.

License Grants and Conditions --------------------------------  2.1. Grants  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:  (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its     Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or     as part of a Larger Work; and  (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer     for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its     Contributions or its Contributor Version.  2.2. Effective Date  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:  (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;     or  (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor     Version); or  (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of     its Contributions.  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).  2.4. Subsequent Licenses  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).  2.5. Representation  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.  2.6. Fair Use  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.  2.7. Conditions  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.  3. Responsibilities -------------------  3.1. Distribution of Source Form  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).  3.4. Notices  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.  3.5. Application of Additional Terms  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation ---------------------------------------------------  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.  5. Termination --------------  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.  ************************************************************************ *                                                                      * *  6.

Litigation -------------  Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.

Miscellaneous ----------------  This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.  10. Versions of the License ---------------------------  10.1. New Versions  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.  10.2. Effect of New Versions  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.  10.3. Modified Versions  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

"mdn-data@2.0.4","CC0-1.0","https://github.com/mdn/data","CC0 1.0 Universal  Statement of Purpose  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an 'owner') of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a 'Work').  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ('Commons') that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the 'Affirmer'), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ('Copyright and Related Rights'). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:    i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,   and translate a Work;    ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);    iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness   depicted in a Work;    iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,   subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;    v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in   a Work;    vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the   European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal   protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,   including any amended or successor version of such directive); and    vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world   based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the 'Waiver'). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the 'License').

This is described as a 'natural ordering'.  ```text Standard sorting:   Natural order sorting:     img1.png            img1.png     img10.png           img2.png     img12.png           img10.png     img2.png            img12.png ```  String.naturalCompare returns a number indicating whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same as the given string in sort order. Use it with builtin sort() function.    ### Installation  - In browser  ```html <script src=min.natural-compare.js></script> ```  - In node.js: `npm install natural-compare-lite`  ```javascript require('natural-compare-lite') ```  ### Usage  ```javascript // Simple case sensitive example var a = ['z1.doc', 'z10.doc', 'z17.doc', 'z2.doc', 'z23.doc', 'z3.doc']; a.sort(String.naturalCompare); // ['z1.doc', 'z2.doc', 'z3.doc', 'z10.doc', 'z17.doc', 'z23.doc']  // Use wrapper function for case insensitivity a.sort(function(a, b){   return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase()); })  // In most cases we want to sort an array of objects var a = [ {'street':'350 5th Ave', 'room':'A-1021'}         , {'street':'350 5th Ave', 'room':'A-21046-b'} ];  // sort by street, then by room a.sort(function(a, b){   return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room); })  // When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()), // it is best for performance to keep // transformed key in that object. // There are no need to do text transformation // on each comparision when sorting. var a = [ {'make':'Audi', 'model':'A6'}         , {'make':'Kia',  'model':'Rio'} ];  // sort by make, then by model a.map(function(car){   car.sort_key = (car.make + ' ' + car.model).toLowerCase(); }) a.sort(function(a, b){   return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key); }) ```  - Works well with dates in ISO format eg 'Rev 2012-07-26.doc'.   ### Custom alphabet  It is possible to configure a custom alphabet to achieve a desired order.  ```javascript // Estonian alphabet String.alphabet = 'ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSŠZŽTUVÕÄÖÜXYabdefghijklmnoprsšzžtuvõäöüxy' ['t', 'z', 'x', 'õ'].sort(String.naturalCompare) // ['z', 't', 'õ', 'x']  // Russian alphabet String.alphabet = 'АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя' ['Ё', 'А', 'Б'].sort(String.naturalCompare) // ['А', 'Б', 'Ё'] ```   External links --------------  -   [GitHub repo][https://github.com/litejs/natural-compare-lite] -   [jsperf test](http://jsperf.com/natural-sort-2/12)   Licence -------  Copyright (c) 2012-2015 Lauri Rooden &lt;lauri@rooden.ee&gt;   [The MIT License](http://lauri.rooden.ee/mit-license.txt)"

It will NOT be called again until the callback is called.  before is called right before the first call to read in order to do setup, it is passed a callback and read will not be called until the callback is called.  like through2 and from2 noms also features  ```js nom.obj([options], read, [before]); ```  which is shorthand for creating an object stream and like from2 noms has  ```js noms.ctor(read, [before]); ```  which returns a constructor function for use if you're creating a large number of copies of the stream.  example (based on one from from2):  ```js function fromString(string) {   return noms(function(size, next) {     // if there's no more content     // left in the string, close the stream.     if (string.length <= 0) {       return this.push(null);     }      // Pull in a new chunk of text,     // removing it from the string.     var chunk = string.slice(0, size);     string = string.slice(size);      // Emit 'chunk' from the stream.     next(null, chunk);   }) } ```  you can use `this.push(foo)` and `next(null, foo)` interchangeably, just remember to call next at the end.  ```js function fromString(string) {   return noms(function(size, next) {     // if there's no more content     // left in the string, close the stream.     if (string.length <= 0) {       return next(null, null);     }      // Pull in a new chunk of text,     // removing it from the string.     var chunk = string.slice(0, size);     string = string.slice(size);      // Emit 'chunk' from the stream.     this.push(chunk);     // finish up     next();   }) } ```  If you don't care about size you can omit it  ```js function fromString(sentence) {   var strings = sentence.trim().split(/\s+/);   var i = -1;   var len = strings.length;   return noms(function(next) {     // if there's no more content     // left in the string, close the stream.     if (++i < len) {       return this.push(strings[i]);     } else {      return this.push(null);     }     next(); } ```  You don't have to worry about the response from this.push, as noms will call the function again after you call next until the cache is full.  ```js var fs = require('fs'); var path = require('path'); function getFiles(dir) {   var stack = [path.resolve(dir)];   return noms(function(next) {     if (!stack.length) {       //we are done       return next(null, null);     }     var self = this;     var current = stack.pop();     fs.readdir(current, function (err, paths) {       if (err) {         return next(err);       }       if (!paths.length) {         // this directory is empty         return next();       }      var todo = paths.length;      paths.forEach(function (file) {         var fullPath = path.join(current, file);         fs.stat(fullPath, function (err, stats) {           todo--;           if (err) {             return next(err);           }           if (stats.isFile()) {             //found a file             // emit it as data             self.push(fullPath);           } else if (stats.isDirectory()) {             // found another directory             // put it into the stack             // is depth first, switch this to             // a shift to make it breadth first             stack.push(fullPath);           }           if (!todo) {             // we've done all the files             // would be a lot simpler if I used promises             // would that help or hurt the example?             next();           }         });       });     });  } ```"

"pn@1.1.0","MIT","https://github.com/cscott/node-pn","# pn [![NPM][NPM1]][NPM2]  [![Build Status][1]][2]  The `pn` library gives you the Promise-using node standard library you've always dreamed of.  Think 'Promised Node' when saying it.  Just about every node standard library method that takes a callback will now return a `Promise` iff no callback is supplied.  But existing code that passes callbacks will still work fine --- and fast:  No unnecessary `Promise`s are created if you supply a callback.  The wrappers are generated automatically by a script, with a table to handle exceptions and odd cases.  See below for more details.  ## Installation ``` npm install pn ``` ## Usage ``` var fs = require('pn/fs'); fs.writeFile('foo', 'bar', 'utf-8').then(function() { console.log('done'); }); // But you can use callbacks, too -- existing code won't break. fs.writeFile('foo', 'bat', 'utf-8', function(err) { console.log('yay'); }); ```  This library uses node native promises (ie `global.Promise`) by default, and thus works with node >= 0.11.  You can use [`core-js`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/core-js) or [`es6-shim`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/es6-shim) to add ES6 Promises to earlier versions of node, for example: ``` require('es6-shim'); var fs = require('pn/fs'); ``` Just be sure that `es6-shim` is loaded before the `pn` package in that case.  You might also want to look into packages like [`prfun`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/prfun) which add some helpers to make working with native promises much more fun.  In particular, the `Promise#done` method is very useful when debugging, at least until v8's native Promise debugging capabilities are completed.  ## Custom Promise types  You can also specify a custom `Promise` type to use, as follows: ``` var MyPromise = require('prfun');  // Use prfun's Promises, for example. require('pn/_promise')(MyPromise); // This only needs to be done once. ```  ## Exceptions and odd cases  The wrappers are automatically generated by `scripts/generate.js`; there is a table in that file which specifies all the odd cases.  In general: if the node API has a callback which takes multiple value arguments, the `Promise` returned will be an object with named fields corresponding to the different values. If the node API takes a callback *and* returns a value, `pn` will return the original value with a nonenumerable field named `promise` corresponding to the callback.  Combining these two cases: ``` var child_process = require('pn/child_process'); var cp = child_process.execFile('true'); console.log('pid', cp.pid); cp.promise.then(function(result) {   console.log('stdout: ', result.stdout);   console.log('stderr: ', result.stderr); }); ```  * `child_process`: The `exec` and `execFile` methods promise a object   with fields named `stdout` and `stderr`.  They return a `ChildProcess`   object with a nonenumerable field named `promise` corresponding to the   callback. * `crypto`: The `randomBytes` and `pseudoRandomBytes` methods are   now always asynchronous, returning a `Promise` if no callback   is supplied.  Use the new `randomBytesSync` and `pseudoRandomBytesSync`   methods if you want synchronous computation.  *This is backwards   incompatible with existing node code.* * `dns`: The `lookupService` method promises an object with   fields named `hostname` and `service`. * `fs`: The `exists` method doesn't pass an error to its callback.   The promisied version will never reject.  The `write` method promises   an object with fields named `written` and `data`.  The `read` method   promises an object with fields named `read` and `data`. * `http`, `https`: The `request` and `get` methods return a `ClientRequest`   object with a nonenumerable field named `promise`, which will   resolve to an `IncomingMessage` object. * `process`: You can defer computation to the next tick with   `require('pn/process').nextTick().then(function(){...})` * `tls`: The `connect` and `createServer` return objects with a   nonenumerable field named `promise`.  There are a few object methods which are not promisified by this package: * `domain`: `Domain#bind`, `Domain#intercept` * `http`,`https`: `ClientRequest#setTimeout`, `IncomingMessage#setTimeout`,   `Server#setTimeout`, `ServerResponse#setTimeout`, `Server#listen`,   `Server#close` * `net`: `Server#listen`, `Server#close`, `Server#getConnections`,   `Socket#write`, `Socket#setTimeout` * `readline`: `Interface#question` * `stream`: `Writable#write`, `Writable#end` * `dgram`: `Socket#send`, `Socket#bind`.  ## Related packages  Here are some other packages with similar aims: * [`promised-node`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/promised-node) * [`then-fs`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/then-fs) * [`final-fs`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/final-fs)  ## License  Copyright (c) 2014-2018 C.

"pnp-webpack-plugin@1.4.3","MIT","https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin","# <img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/master/logo/icon-square-small.png' height='40' align='right' /> [Plug'n'Play](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/pull/101) resolver for Webpack  [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pnp-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnp-webpack-plugin) [![node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/pnp-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnp-webpack-plugin)  *This plugin is also available for Jest ([jest-pnp-resolver](https://github.com/arcanis/jest-pnp-resolver)), Rollup ([rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve](https://github.com/arcanis/rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve)), and TypeScript ([ts-pnp](https://github.com/arcanis/ts-pnp))*  ## Installation  ``` yarn add -D pnp-webpack-plugin ```  ## Usage  Simply add the plugin to both the `resolver` and `resolveLoader`:  ```js const PnpWebpackPlugin = require(`pnp-webpack-plugin`);  module.exports = {   resolve: {     plugins: [       PnpWebpackPlugin,     ],   },   resolveLoader: {     plugins: [       PnpWebpackPlugin.moduleLoader(module),     ],   }, }; ```  The `resolve` entry will take care of correctly resolving the dependencies required by your program, and the `resolveLoader` entry will help Webpack find the location of the loaders on the disk. Note that in this case, all loaders will be resolved relative to the package containing your configuration.  In case part of your configuration comes from third-party packages that use their own loaders, make sure they use `require.resolve` - this will ensure that the resolution process is portable accross environments (including when Plug'n'Play isn't enabled), and prevent it from relying on undefined behaviors:  ```js module.exports = {   module: {     rules: [{       test: /\.js$/,       loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),     }]   }, }; ```  ### `ts-loader` integration  This plugin as an integration to easily add support for TypeScript in your applications through `ts-loader`. In order to do this, just do the following:  ```js const PnpWebpackPlugin = require(`pnp-webpack-plugin`);  module.exports = {   module: {     rules: [{       test: /\.ts$/,       loader: require.resolve('ts-loader'),       options: PnpWebpackPlugin.tsLoaderOptions(),     }],   }, }; ```  If you have any options you want to pass to `ts-loader`, just pass them as parameter of the `tsLoaderOptions` function and it will take care of forwarding them properly.  ## License (MIT)  > **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison** > > Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: > > The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. > > THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

HERE BEGINS THE INTERESTING STUFF 🚨 -->  ## Wut? Poppers?  A popper is an element on the screen which 'pops out' from the natural flow of your application.   Common examples of poppers are tooltips, popovers and drop-downs.   ## So, yet another tooltip library?  Well, basically, **no**.   Popper.js is a **positioning engine**, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element to make it possible to position it near a given reference element.    The engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as **modifiers** (similar to middlewares or plugins).   The whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).  Popper.js has zero dependencies. No jQuery, no LoDash, nothing.   It's used by big companies like [Twitter in Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Microsoft in WebClipper](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper) and [Atlassian in AtlasKit](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/).  ### Popper.js  This is the engine, the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to the poppers.  Some of the key points are:  - Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn't mess with your DOM!); - Allows to export the computed informations to integrate with React and other view libraries; - Supports Shadow DOM elements; - Completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure;  Visit our [project page](https://fezvrasta.github.io/popper.js) to see a lot of examples of what you can do with Popper.js!  Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md).   ### Tooltip.js  Since lots of users just need a simple way to integrate powerful tooltips in their projects, we created **Tooltip.js**.   It's a small library that makes it easy to automatically create tooltips using as engine Popper.js.   Its API is almost identical to the famous tooltip system of Bootstrap, in this way it will be easy to integrate it in your projects.   The tooltips generated by Tooltip.js are accessible thanks to the `aria` tags.  Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/tooltip-documentation.md).   ## Installation Popper.js is available on the following package managers and CDNs:  | Source |                                                                                  | |:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | npm    | `npm install popper.js --save`                                                   | | yarn   | `yarn add popper.js`                                                             | | NuGet  | `PM> Install-Package popper.js`                                                  | | Bower  | `bower install popper.js --save`                     | | unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/popper.js`](https://unpkg.com/popper.js)                     | | cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |  Tooltip.js as well:  | Source |                                                                                  | |:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | npm    | `npm install tooltip.js --save`                                                  | | yarn   | `yarn add tooltip.js`                                                            | | Bower* | `bower install tooltip.js=https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js --save`                   | | unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js`](https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js)                   | | cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |  \*: Bower isn't officially supported, it can be used to install Tooltip.js only trough the unpkg.com CDN. This method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library. Bower and Popper.js suggests to use npm or Yarn for your projects.   For more info, [read the related issue](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/390).  ### Dist targets  Popper.js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind: UMD, ESM and ESNext.  - UMD - Universal Module Definition: AMD, RequireJS and globals; - ESM - ES Modules: For webpack/Rollup or browser supporting the spec; - ESNext: Available in `dist/`, can be used with webpack and `babel-preset-env`;  Make sure to use the right one for your needs. If you want to import it with a `<script>` tag, use UMD.  ## Usage  Given an existing popper DOM node, ask Popper.js to position it near its button  ```js var reference = document.querySelector('.my-button'); var popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper'); var anotherPopper = new Popper(     reference,     popper,     {         // popper options here     } ); ```  ### Callbacks  Popper.js supports two kinds of callbacks, the `onCreate` callback is called after the popper has been initialized. The `onUpdate` one is called on any subsequent update.  ```js const reference = document.querySelector('.my-button'); const popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper'); new Popper(reference, popper, {     onCreate: (data) => {         // data is an object containing all the informations computed         // by Popper.js and used to style the popper and its arrow         // The complete description is available in Popper.js documentation     },     onUpdate: (data) => {         // same as `onCreate` but called on subsequent updates     } }); ```  ### Writing your own modifiers  Popper.js is based on a 'plugin-like' architecture, most of its features are fully encapsulated 'modifiers'.   A modifier is a function that is called each time Popper.js needs to compute the position of the popper. For this reason, modifiers should be very performant to avoid bottlenecks.    To learn how to create a modifier, [read the modifiers documentation](docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md#modifiers--object)   ### React, Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, Ember.js (etc...) integration  Integrating 3rd party libraries in React or other libraries can be a pain because they usually alter the DOM and drive the libraries crazy.   Popper.js limits all its DOM modifications inside the `applyStyle` modifier, you can simply disable it and manually apply the popper coordinates using your library of choice.    For a comprehensive list of libraries that let you use Popper.js into existing frameworks, visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page.  Alternatively, you may even override your own `applyStyles` with your custom one and integrate Popper.js by yourself!  ```js function applyReactStyle(data) {     // export data in your framework and use its content to apply the style to your popper };  const reference = document.querySelector('.my-button'); const popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper'); new Popper(reference, popper, {     modifiers: {         applyStyle: { enabled: false },         applyReactStyle: {             enabled: true,             fn: applyReactStyle,             order: 800,         },     }, });  ```  ### Migration from Popper.js v0  Since the API changed, we prepared some migration instructions to make it easy to upgrade to Popper.js v1.    https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/62  Feel free to comment inside the issue if you have any questions.  ### Performances  Popper.js is very performant. It usually takes 0.5ms to compute a popper's position (on an iMac with 3.5G GHz Intel Core i5).   This means that it will not cause any [jank](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool/anatomy-of-jank), leading to a smooth user experience.  ## Notes  ### Libraries using Popper.js  The aim of Popper.js is to provide a stable and powerful positioning engine ready to be used in 3rd party libraries.    Visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page for an updated list of projects.   ### Credits I want to thank some friends and projects for the work they did:  - [@AndreaScn](https://github.com/AndreaScn) for his work on the GitHub Page and the manual testing he did during the development; - [@vampolo](https://github.com/vampolo) for the original idea and for the name of the library; - [Sysdig](https://github.com/Draios) for all the awesome things I learned during these years that made it possible for me to write this library; - [Tether.js](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/) for having inspired me in writing a positioning library ready for the real world; - [The Contributors](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/graphs/contributors) for their much appreciated Pull Requests and bug reports; - **you** for the star you'll give to this project and for being so awesome to give this project a try 🙂  ### Copyright and license Code and documentation copyright 2016 **Federico Zivolo**.

"raf-schd@4.0.2","MIT","https://github.com/alexreardon/raf-schd","# raf-schd  A `throttle` function that uses [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) to limit the rate at which a function is called.  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexreardon/raf-schd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexreardon/raf-schd) [![dependencies](https://david-dm.org/alexreardon/raf-schd.svg)](https://david-dm.org/alexreardon/raf-schd) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/raf-schd.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raf-schd) [![SemVer](https://img.shields.io/badge/SemVer-2.0.0-brightgreen.svg)](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)  > For background information on rate limiting functions, see [Rate limiting functions from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_3e_bNU2e0)  ```js import rafSchd from 'raf-schd';  const expensiveFn = arg => {   //...   console.log(arg); };  const schedule = rafSchd(expensiveFn);  schedule('foo'); schedule('bar'); schedule('baz');  // animation frame fires  // => 'baz' ```  ## Why?  `raf-schd` supports the use case where you want to limit the rate at which your functions are called based on `requestAnimationFrame`. Unlike a standard `throttle` function, `raf-schd` uses `requestAnimationFrame` to rate limit, rather than waiting a fixed amount of time. Using `requestAnimationFrame` for throttling is powerful because the browser will automatically reduce the amount of frames provided based on the available resources. So if the browser only provides 30fps then your throttled function will only be called 30 times.  `raf-schd` is an **extremely** useful performance utility.  ### Without `raf-schd`  > Optimised scroll listener example taken from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/scroll)  ```js var last_known_scroll_position = 0; var ticking = false;  function doSomething(scroll_pos) {   // do something with the scroll position }  window.addEventListener('scroll', function(e) {   last_known_scroll_position = window.scrollY;   if (!ticking) {     window.requestAnimationFrame(function() {       doSomething(last_known_scroll_position);       ticking = false;     });   }   ticking = true; }); ```  ### With `raf-schd`  ```js import rafSchd from 'raf-schd';  function doSomething(scroll_pos) {   // do something with the scroll position }  const schedule = rafSchd(doSomething);  window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {   schedule(window.scrollY); }); ```  At the top level `raf-schd` accepts any function a returns a new `ResultFn` (a function that wraps your original function).  The `ResultFn` will execute your function with the **latest arguments** provided to it on the next animation frame.  ### Throttled with latest argument  ```js import rafSchd from 'raf-schd';  const doSomething = () => {...};  const schedule = rafSchd(doSomething);  schedule(1, 2); schedule(3, 4); schedule(5, 6);  // animation frame fires  // do something called with => '5, 6' ```  ### Cancelling a frame with `.cancel`  `raf-schd` adds a `.cancel` property to the `ResultFn` so that it can be easily cancelled. The frame will only be cancelled if it has not yet executed.  ```js const schedule = rafSchd(doSomething);  schedule('foo');  schedule.cancel();  // now doSomething will not be executed in the next animation frame ```  ## Types  ### `rafSchedule`  ```js type rafSchedule = (fn: Function) => ResultFn;  // Adding a .cancel property to the WrapperFn  type WrapperFn = (...arg: mixed[]) => void; type CancelFn = {|   cancel: () => void, |}; type ResultFn = WrapperFn & CancelFn; ```  ## Testing your code  If you want to really ensure that your code is working how you intend it to - use [`raf-stub`](https://github.com/alexreardon/raf-stub) to test your animation frame logic.  ## Installation  ```bash # yarn yarn add raf-schd  # npm npm install raf-schd --save ```  ## Module usage  ### ES6 module  ```js import rafSchd from 'raf-schd'; ```  ### CommonJS  If you are in a CommonJS environment (eg [Node](https://nodejs.org)), then **you will need add `.default` to your import**:  ```js const rafSchd = require('raf-schd').default; ```"

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The goals are:    - 100% compatibility with browser pathname resolution   - Pure JavaScript implementation (no DOM dependency)  ## Installation  Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):      $ npm install --save resolve-pathname  Then, use as you would anything else:  ```js // using ES6 modules import resolvePathname from 'resolve-pathname'  // using CommonJS modules var resolvePathname = require('resolve-pathname') ```  The UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):  ```html <script src='https://unpkg.com/resolve-pathname/umd/resolve-pathname.min.js'></script> ```  You can find the library on `window.resolvePathname`.  ## Usage  ```js import resolvePathname from 'resolve-pathname'  // Simply pass the pathname you'd like to resolve. Second // argument is the path we're coming from, or the current // pathname. It defaults to '/'. resolvePathname('about', '/company/jobs') // /company/about resolvePathname('../jobs', '/company/team/ceo') // /company/jobs resolvePathname('about') // /about resolvePathname('/about') // /about  // Index paths (with a trailing slash) are also supported and // work the same way as browsers. resolvePathname('about', '/company/info/') // /company/info/about  // In browsers, it's easy to resolve a URL pathname relative to // the current page. Just use window.location! e.g. if // window.location.pathname == '/company/team/ceo' then resolvePathname('cto', window.location.pathname) // /company/team/cto resolvePathname('../jobs', window.location.pathname) // /company/jobs ```  ## Prior Work  - [url.resolve](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_url_resolve_from_to) - node's `url.resolve` implementation for full URLs - [resolve-url](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-url) - A DOM-dependent implementation of the same algorithm"

"run-queue@1.0.3","ISC","https://github.com/iarna/run-queue","# run-queue  A promise based, dynamic priority queue runner, with concurrency limiting.  ```js const RunQueue = require('run-queue')  const queue = new RunQueue({   maxConcurrency: 1 })  queue.add(1, example, [-1]) for (let ii = 0; ii < 5; ++ii) {   queue.add(0, example, [ii]) } const finished = [] queue.run().then(   console.log(finished) })  function example (num, next) {   setTimeout(() => {     finished.push(num)     next()   }, 5 - Math.abs(num)) } ```  would output  ``` [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 ] ```  If you bump concurrency to `2`, then you get:  ``` [ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ] ```  The concurrency means that they don't finish in order, because some take longer than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the next priority level is run.  See [PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue can execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:  ``` [ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ] ```  ## API  ### const queue = new RunQueue(options)  Create a new queue. Options may contain:  * maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once. * Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.  ### queue.add (prio, fn, args)  Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn` with `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.  ### queue.run ()  Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected with that error and no further queue running will be done.  ## PRIORITIES  Priorities are any integer value >= 0.  Lowest is executed first.  Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.  This means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0` must complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs while `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0` queue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs complete."

"sane@4.1.0","MIT","https://github.com/amasad/sane","[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane)  sane ----  I've been driven to insanity by node filesystem watcher wrappers. Sane aims to be fast, small, and reliable file system watcher. It does that by:  * By default stays away from fs polling because it's very slow and cpu intensive * Uses `fs.watch` by default and sensibly works around the various issues * Maintains a consistent API across different platforms * Where `fs.watch` is not reliable you have the choice of using the following alternatives:   * [the facebook watchman library](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)   * [the watchexec library](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)   * polling  ## Install  ``` $ npm install sane ```  ## How to choose a mode  Don't worry too much about choosing the correct mode upfront because sane maintains the same API across all modes and will be easy to switch.  * If you're only supporting Linux and OS X, `watchman` would be the most reliable mode * If you're using node > v0.10.0 use the default mode * If you're running OS X and you're watching a lot of directories and you're running into https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5463, use `watchman` * If you're in an environment where native file system events aren't available (like Vagrant), you should use polling * Otherwise, the default mode should work well for you  ## API  ### sane(dir, options)  Watches a directory and all its descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions on files and directories.  ```js var watcher = sane('path/to/dir', {glob: ['**/*.js', '**/*.css']}); watcher.on('ready', function () { console.log('ready') }); watcher.on('change', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file changed', filepath); }); watcher.on('add', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file added', filepath); }); watcher.on('delete', function (filepath, root) { console.log('file deleted', filepath); }); // close watcher.close(); ```  options:  * `glob`: a single string glob pattern or an array of them. * `poll`: puts the watcher in polling mode. Under the hood that means `fs.watchFile`. * `watchman`: makes the watcher use [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/). * `watchmanPath`: sets a custom path for `watchman` binary. * `watchexec`: makes the watcher use [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec). * `dot`: enables watching files/directories that start with a dot. * `ignored`: a glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.  For the glob pattern documentation, see [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch). If you choose to use `watchman` you'll have to [install watchman yourself](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)). If you choose to use `watchexec` you'll have to [install watchexec yourself](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)). For the ignored options, see [anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch).  ### sane.NodeWatcher(dir, options)  The default watcher class. Uses `fs.watch` under the hood, and takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.  ### sane.WatchmanWatcher(dir, options)  The watchman watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.  ### sane.Watchexec(dir, options)  The watchexec watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.  ### sane.PollWatcher(dir, options)  The polling watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)` with the addition of:  * interval: indicates how often the files should be polled. (passed to fs.watchFile)  ### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher#close  Stops watching.  ### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher events  Emits the following events:  All events are passed the file/dir path relative to the root directory * `ready` when the program is ready to detect events in the directory * `change` when a file changes * `add` when a file or directory has been added * `delete` when a file or directory has been deleted  ## CLI  This module includes a simple command line interface, which you can install with `npm install sane -g`.  ``` Usage: sane <command> [...directory] [--glob=<filePattern>] [--poll] [--watchman] [--watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>] [--dot] [--wait=<seconds>]  OPTIONS:     --glob=<filePattern>       A single string glob pattern or an array of them.      --ignored=<filePattern>       A glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.      --poll, -p       Use polling mode.      --watchman, -w       Use watchman (if available).      --watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>       Sets a custom path for watchman binary (if using this mode).      --dot, -d       Enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.      --wait=<seconds>       Duration, in seconds, that watching will be disabled       after running <command>. Setting this option will       throttle calls to <command> for the specified duration.     --quiet, -q       Disables sane's console output      --changes-only, -o       Runs <command> only when a change occur. Skips running <command> at startup ```  It will watch the given `directory` and run the given <command> every time a file changes.  ### CLI example usage - `sane 'echo 'A command ran''` - `sane 'echo 'A command ran'' --glob='**/*.css'` - `sane 'echo 'A command ran'' site/assets/css --glob='**/*.css'` - `sane 'echo 'A command ran'' --glob='**/*.css' --ignored='**/ignore.css'` - `sane 'echo 'A command ran'' --wait=3` - `sane 'echo 'A command ran'' -p`  ## License  MIT  ## Credits The CLI was originally based on the [watch CLI](https://github.com/mikeal/watch).

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner.

Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

[`stable.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.js  [`stable.min.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.min.js  #### Usage  The default sort is, as with `Array#sort`, lexicographical:  ```js stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo'] stable([10, 1, 5])             // => [1, 10, 5] ```  Unlike `Array#sort`, the default sort is **NOT** in-place. To do an in-place sort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:  ```js const arr = [10, 1, 5] stable(arr) === arr          // => false stable.inplace(arr) === arr  // => true ```  A comparator function can be specified:  ```js // Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number. // This demonstrates the default behavior. const lexCmp = (a, b) => String(a).localeCompare(b) stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], lexCmp)  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']  // Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true. // This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically. const greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b stable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10] ```  #### License  Copyright (C) 2018 Angry Bytes and contributors.

"store2@2.8.0","(MIT OR GPL-3.0)","https://github.com/nbubna/store","A feature-filled and friendly way to take advantage of localStorage and sessionStorage (JSON, namespacing, extensions, etc).  Download: [store2.min.js][prod]  or  [store2.js][dev]   [NPM][npm]: `npm install store2`   [NuGet][]: `Install-Package store2`    [NuGet]: http://nuget.org/packages/store2/ [prod]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/dist/store2.min.js [dev]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/dist/store2.js [npm]: https://npmjs.org/package/store2  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nbubna/store.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nbubna/store) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/store2.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/store2) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/store2.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/store2)    ## Documentation The main store function can handle ```set```, ```get```, ```transact```, ```setAll```, ```getAll``` and ```clear``` actions directly. Respectively, these are called like so:  ```javascript store(key, data);                 // sets stringified data under key store(key);                       // gets and parses data stored under key store(key, fn[, alt]);            // run transaction function on/with data stored under key store({key: data, key2: data2});  // sets all key/data pairs in the object store();                          // gets all stored key/data pairs as an object store(fn);                        // calls fn for each key/data in storage, return false to exit early store(false);                     // clears all items from storage ```  Parameters in [brackets] are optional. There are also more explicit and versatile functions available:  ```javascript store.set(key, data[, overwrite]); // === store(key, data); store.setAll(data[, overwrite]);   // === store({key: data, key2: data}); store.get(key[, alt]);             // === store(key); store.getAll([fillObj]);           // === store(); store.transact(key, fn[, alt]);    // === store(key, fn[, alt]); store.clear();                     // === store(false); store.has(key);                    // returns true or false store.remove(key);                 // removes key and its data, then returns the data store.each(fn[, fill]);            // === store(fn); optional call arg will be 3rd fn arg (e.g. for gathering values) store.add(key, data);              // concats, merges, or adds new value into existing one store.keys([fillList]);            // returns array of keys store.size();                      // number of keys, not length of data store.clearAll();                  // clears *ALL* areas (but still namespace sensitive) ```  Passing in ```false``` for the optional overwrite parameters will cause ```set``` actions to be skipped  if the storage already has a value for that key. All ```set``` action methods return the previous value  for that key, by default. If overwrite is ```false``` and there is a previous value, the unused new  value will be returned.  Functions passed to ```transact``` will receive the current value for that key as an argument or a passed alternate if there is none. When the passed function is completed, transact will save the returned value under the specified key. If the function returns ```undefined```, the original value will be saved. This makes it easy for transact functions to change internal properties in a persistent way:  ```javascript store.transact(key, function(obj) {     obj.changed = 'newValue';// this change will be persisted }); ```  Functions passed to ```each``` will receive the key as first argument and current value as the second; if a `fill` parameter is specified, it's value will be the third argument for every call (few should ever need a `fill` parameter). If the function returns ```false``` at any point during the iteration, the loop will exit early and not continue on to the next key/value pair.  ```javascript store.each(function(key, value) {     console.log(key, '->', value);     if (key === 'stopLoop') {         return false;// this will cause each to stop calling this function     } }); ```  For ```getAll``` and ```keys```, there is the option to pass in the object or list, respectively, that you want the results to be added to. This is instead of an empty list. There are only a few special cases where you are likely to need or want this, in general, most users should ignore these optional parameters. These both use the  second, optional argument ```each``` function, which is also a niche feature. The ```value``` argument is passed as the second arg to the callback function (in place of the data associated with the current key) and is returned at the end. Again, most users should not need this feature. All of these use the browser's localStorage (aka 'local'). Using sessionStorage merely requires  calling the same functions on ```store.session```:  ```javascript store.session('addMeTo', 'sessionStorage'); store.local({lots: 'of', data: 'altogether'});// store.local === store :) ``` All the specific ```get```, ```set```, etc. functions are available on both ```store.session``` and ```store.local```, as well as any other storage facility registered via ```store.area(name, customStorageObject)``` by an extension, where customStorageObject must implement the [Storage interface][storage]. This is how [store.old.js][old] extends store.js to support older versions of IE and Firefox.  [storage]: http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/#the-storage-interface  If you want to put stored data from different pages or areas of your site into separate namespaces,  the ```store.namespace(ns)``` function is your friend:  ```javascript var cart = store.namespace('cart'); cart('total', 23.25);// stores in localStorage as 'cart.total' console.log(store('cart.total') == cart('total'));// logs true console.log(store.cart.getAll());// logs {total: 23.25} cart.session('group', 'toys');// stores in sessionStorage as 'cart.group' ```  The namespace provides the same exact API as ```store``` but silently adds/removes the namespace prefix as needed. It also makes the namespaced API accessible directly via ```store[namespace]``` (e.g. ```store.cart```) as long as it does not conflict with an existing part of the store API.  The 'namespace' function is one of two 'extra' functions that are also part of the 'store API':  ```javascript store.namespace(prefix[, noSession]);// returns a new store API that prefixes all key-based functions store.isFake();// is this storage persistent? (e.g. is this old IE?)  ```  If localStorage or sessionStorage are unavailable, they will be faked to prevent errors, but data stored will NOT persist beyond the life of the current document/page. Use the  [store.old.js][old] extension to add persistent backing for the store API in ancient browsers.  ## Extensions These mostly could use further documentation and abuse...er...testing. Contributions are welcome! In particular, any ES6 user interested in making these [importable in ES6][es6importissue] would be appreciated.  [es6importissue]: https://github.com/nbubna/store/issues/31  #### Beta - Stable and definitely useful * [store.old.js][old] - Add working localStorage and sessionStorage polyfills for ancient browsers * [store.overflow.js][overflow] - Fall back to fake storage on quota errors * [store.cache.js][cache] - To make data expire, pass a number of seconds as the overwrite (third) param on ```set()``` calls * [store.on.js][on] - Superior storage event handling (per key, per namespace, etc in IE9+) * [store.array.js][array] - Easy, powerful array functions for any and all data (e.g. ```store.push(key, v1, v2)```). * [store.dom.js][dom] - Declarative, persistent DOM element content via store.  #### Alpha - Either incomplete or unstable or both * [store.quota.js][quota] - Register callbacks to handle (and even cancel) quota errors * [store.measure.js][measure] - Experimental extension for measuring space used and available (needs work) * [store.onlyreal.js][onlyreal] - When only fake storage is available, silently fail instead of faking it. * [store.dot.js][dot] - Creates accessors for keys (e.g. ```store.foo == store.get('foo')```) * [store.deep.js][deep] - Allow retrieval of properties from within stored objects (e.g. ```store.get('key.property')```) * [store.async.js][async] - Adds ```store.async``` duplicate to each store and namespace that performs functions asynchronously and returns a Promise that resolves when complete.   [old]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.old.js [overflow]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.overflow.js [cache]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.cache.js [on]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.on.js [quota]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.quota.js [measure]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.measure.js [onlyreal]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.onlyreal.js [array]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.array.js [dot]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.dot.js [deep]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.deep.js [dom]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.dom.js [async]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.async.js  #### Write Your Own Extension To write your own extension, you can use or carefully override internal functions exposed as ```store._```. In particular, the ```store._.fn(fnName, fn)``` method is available to automatically add your new function to every instance of the ```store``` interface (e.g. ```store```, ```store.session``` and all existing and future namespaces). Take care using this, as it will override existing methods. Here is a simple example:  ```javascript (function(_) {     _.fn('falsy', function(key) {         return !this.get(key);     });     _.fn('truthy', function(key) {         return !this.falsy(key);     }); })(store._); ``` This extension would be used like so: ```javascript store('foo', 1); store.falsy('foo'); // returns false  store.session('bar', 'one'); store.session.truthy('bar'); // return true;  const widgetStore = store.namespace('widget'); widgetStore.falsy('state'); // returns true ```  ## Release History * 2010-02-10 v0.1 (extraction from esha.js) * 2010-05-25 v1.0 (internal release) * 2013-04-09 [v2.0.3][] (public) - First GitHub release * 2013-04-20 [v2.1.0][] (public) - Drops flawed/confusing/unused key(i) method, fixes extension problems. * 2013-04-30 [v2.1.1][] (public) - Browserify (and friends) support (module.exports = store) * 2013-05-30 [v2.1.2][] (public) - Component support (old component.json is now bower.json) * 2014-03-10 [v2.1.6][] (public) - AMD support and Component improvements * 2015-02-02 [v2.2.0][] (public) - Change store.cache.js to use seconds, not minutes. * 2015-05-05 [v2.2.1][] (public) - node.js compatibility * 2015-05-08 [v2.2.2][] (public) - Always expose global to allow extensions to always work. * 2015-05-22 [v2.3.0][] (public) - Use fake storage for Safari private mode (instead of letting quota exceptions go) * 2015-10-27 [v2.3.2][] (public) - Add source map * 2017-01-04 [v2.4.0][] (public) - Add store.transact(key, fn[, alt]) * 2017-01-09 [v2.5.0][] (public) - Update for issue #34; new extensions (array, dot, and deep); only expose global in non-AMD/CommonJS environments (PR #35) * 2017-08-09 [v2.5.2][] (public) - Fix `clear()` in fake storage (thx to Martin Kluska) * 2018-01-18 [v2.5.11][] (public) - Add ```index.d.ts``` in root to provide TypeScript support * 2018-01-23 [v2.6.0][] (public) - Support ```each(fn,value)```, ```getAll(fillObj)```, and ```keys(fillList)``` to support some advanced/corner cases * 2018-11-15 [v2.7.1][] (public) - Add ```add(key, data)``` for common case of saving a combination of existing and new data.

To my pleasure, even our APIs had notable overlap, but his had fewer features and a focus on polyfilling old browsers (e.g. IE 6/7). He saw the library at the time as a temporary polyfill, while i intended mine to always be a better way to use localStorage and sessionStorage. We discussed merging the featuresets, but we agreed it wouldn't work due to different goals. To minimize confusion, i published this as 'store2', but kept the main function as `store`. Marcus' later decision to pivot and adopt the goals and many of the features of this library into a v2 of store.js has put these libraries into more direct competition. I believe this library to be superior in implementation and interface, though not in all aspects and the differences are admittedly small. There is still potential for unification, perhaps in a v3 someday.  [other]: https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js/"

Create themable React Components. - Works with Storybook 3.0  ## Quick Start  In order to quick start with the latest `storybook-addon-material-ui` you can check out [create-material-ui-app](https://github.com/react-theming/create-material-ui-app)  It contains the working setup with:  - create-react-app - Storybook - Material-UI - storybook-addon-material-ui  ---  ## Roadmap :mountain_cableway:  We have many plans and ideas for further development. See [**projects**](https://github.com/react-theming/storybook-addon-material-ui/projects/1) about what kind of features we plan to implement in the future. We create this tool for your convenience and productivity, so we are always happy to [**hear**](https://github.com/react-theming/storybook-addon-material-ui/issues/new) your ideas and wishes.  ## Getting Started :bookmark_tabs:  First, install the addon  ```shell npm i storybook-addon-material-ui --save-dev ```  Add this line to your addons.js file (create this file inside your storybook config directory if needed).  ```js import 'storybook-addon-material-ui/register'; ```  Now, write your stories with Material-UI Addon. By default your stories will be provided with [`Light Base Theme`](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/blob/master/src/styles/baseThemes/lightBaseTheme.js) and [`Dark Base Theme`](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/blob/master/src/styles/baseThemes/darkBaseTheme.js)  ```js import React from 'react'; import { storiesOf, addDecorator } from '@storybook/react'; import {muiTheme} from 'storybook-addon-material-ui';  // Import some examples from material-ui import CardExampleControlled from '../CardExampleControlled.jsx'; import RaisedButtonExampleSimple from '../RaisedButtonExampleSimple.jsx'; import DatePickerExampleSimple from '../DatePickerExampleSimple.jsx';  storiesOf('Material-UI', module) // Add the `muiTheme` decorator to provide material-ui support to your stories. // If you do not specify any arguments it starts with two default themes // You can also configure `muiTheme` as a global decorator.     .addDecorator(muiTheme())     .add('Card Example Controlled', () => (             <CardExampleControlled />         ))     .add('Raised Button Example Simple', () => (             <RaisedButtonExampleSimple />         ))     .add('Date Picker Example Simple', () => (             <DatePickerExampleSimple />         )); ``` > Note : You can switch between the loaded themes. Out of the box, you have two base themes, but you can simply add your custom themes like this:  ```js import React from 'react'; import { storiesOf, addDecorator } from '@storybook/react';  import {muiTheme} from 'storybook-addon-material-ui';  import CardExampleControlled from '../CardExampleControlled.jsx'; import RaisedButtonExampleSimple from '../RaisedButtonExampleSimple.jsx'; import DatePickerExampleSimple from '../DatePickerExampleSimple.jsx';  // Create your own theme like this. // Note: you can specify theme name in `themeName` field. Otherwise it will be displayed by the number. // you can specify only required fields overriding the `Light Base Theme` const newTheme = {     themeName: 'Grey Theme',     palette: {         primary1Color: '#00bcd4',         alternateTextColor: '#4a4a4a',         canvasColor: '#616161',         textColor: '#bdbdbd',         secondaryTextColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.54)',         disabledColor: '#757575',         accent1Color: '#607d8b',     }, };    storiesOf('Material-UI', module)     .addDecorator(muiTheme([newTheme]))     .add('Card Example Controlled', () => (             <CardExampleControlled />         ))     .add('Raised Button Example Simple', () => (             <RaisedButtonExampleSimple />         ))     .add('Date Picker Example Simple', () => (             <DatePickerExampleSimple />         ));   ```  ## Feedback  **You can left your opinion about this project via anonymous [survey](https://app.qpointsurvey.com/s.aspx?c=**F2VOSpTXOlnHHqMaZKSSV5a1ylaCDoRfhut3oNCox34~**).**   ## Query string parameters  As you select themes and other options it stores in adress bar line. So this state is retained when you refresh the page and you can use direct links to the desired states.  ``` http://localhost:9001/?theme-ind=0&theme-sidebar=true&theme-full=true ```  ## CONTRIBUTING :raising_hand:  [![@airbnb](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-Airbnb-brightgreen.svg)](./.eslintrc) [![Code Triagers Badge](https://www.codetriage.com/react-theming/storybook-addon-material-ui/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/react-theming/storybook-addon-material-ui)  ### :wrench: Developers:  Our team welcome all contributing, testing, bug fixing.

"telejson@2.2.2","MIT","https://github.com/storybooks/telejson","# TeleJSON  A library for teleporting rich data to another place.  ## Install  ```sh yarn add telejson ```  ## What can it do, what can't it do:  `JSON.parse` & `JSON.stringify` have limitation by design, because there are no data formats for things like - Date - Function - Class - Symbol - etc.  Also JSON doesn't support cyclic data structures.  This library allows you to pass in data with all all the above properties. It will transform the properties to something that's allowed by the JSON spec whilst stringifying, and then convert back to the cyclic data structure when parsing.  When parsing, **class instances** will be given the Class's name again. The prototype isn't copied over.  **Functions** are supported, they are stringified and will be eval-ed when called.  This lazy eval is important for performance. The eval happens via `eval()` Functions are stripped of comments and whitespace.  > Obviously calling the function will only really work as expected if the functions were pure the begin with.  **Regular expressions** just work.  **Symbol** will be re-created with the same string. (resulting in a similar, but different symbol)  **Dates** are parsed back into actual Date objects.  ## API  You have 2 choices:  ```js import { stringify, parse } from 'telejson';  const Foo = function(){};  const root = {   date: new Date('2018'),   regex1: /foo/,   regex2: /foo/g,   regex2: new RegExp('foo','i'),   fn1: () => 'foo',   fn2: function fn2() { return 'foo'; },   Foo: new Foo(), };  // something cyclic root.root = root;  const stringified = stringify(root); const parsed = parse(stringified); ```  stringify and parse do not conform to the JSON.stringify or JSON.parse api. they take an data object and a option object.  OR you can use use the `replacer` and `reviver`:  ```js import { replacer, reviver } from 'telejson'; import data from 'somewhere';  const stringified = JSON.stringify(data, reviver(), 2); const parsed = JSON.parse(stringified, reviver(), 2); ```  notice that both replacer and reviver need to be called! doing the following will NOT WORK:  ``` const stringified = JSON.stringify(data, reviver, 2); const parsed = JSON.parse(stringified, reviver, 2); ```  ## options  You either pass the options-object to `replacer` or as a second argument to `stringify`:  ```js replacer({ maxDepth: 10 }); stringify(date, { maxDepth: 10 }); ```  ### replacer  `maxDepth`: controls how deep to keep stringifying. When max depth is reach,  objects will be replaced with `'[Object]'`, arrays will be replaced with `'[Array(<length>)]'`. default value is `10` This option is really useful if your object is huge/complex, and you don't care about the deeply nested data.  `space`: controls how to prettify the output string. default value is `undefined`, no white space is used. Only relevant when using `stringify`.  `allowFunction`: When set to false, functions will not be serialized. (default = true)  `allowRegExp`: When set to false, regular expressions will not be serialized. (default = true)  `allowClass`: When set to false, class instances will not be serialized. (default = true)  `allowDate`: When set to false, Date objects will not be serialized. (default = true)  `allowUndefined`: When set to false, `undefined` will not be serialized. (default = true)  `allowSymbol`: When set to false, Symbols will not be serialized. (default = true)  ### reviver  Doesn't take any options right now.  ## Contributing  If you have any suggestions, please open an issue.  All contributions are welcome!  ### run tests:  ```sh yarn test ```"

Preamble    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The 'Program', below, refers to any such program or work, and a 'work based on the Program' means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 'modification'.)  Each licensee is addressed as 'you'.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third     parties under the terms of this License.      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium     customarily used for software interchange; or,      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you     received the program in object code or executable form with such     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and 'any later version', you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.            NO WARRANTY    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."

"ts-pnp@1.1.2","MIT","https://github.com/arcanis/ts-pnp","# <img src='http://www.typescriptlang.org/assets/images/icons/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png' height='40' align='right' /> [Plug'n'Play](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/pull/101) resolver for TypeScript  [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ts-pnp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-pnp) [![node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/ts-pnp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-pnp)  *This plugin is also available for Webpack ([pnp-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin)), Jest ([jest-pnp-resolver](https://github.com/arcanis/jest-pnp-resolver)), and Rollup ([rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve](https://github.com/arcanis/rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve))*  ## Installation  ``` yarn add -D ts-pnp ```  ## Usage  *Note that `ts-pnp` is a low-level package - you shouldn't have to use it unless you're writing a TS compiler host. If you just want to write TypeScript and have it Just Work™, take a look at [`pnp-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin#ts-loader-integration) instead.*  This package exports a function that can be used to implement the [`resolveModuleName` hook from `CompilerHost`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#customizing-module-resolution). It mimics the interface from the one you'd typically use and, as all other PnP plugins, works just fine whether your application is actually running under PnP or not.  ```js import {resolveModuleName} from 'ts-pnp'; import * as ts from 'typescript';  function createCompilerHost(   compilerOptions: ts.CompilerOptions, ): ts.CompilerHost {   const compilerHost = {     resolveModuleNames,     resolveTypeReferenceDirectives,   };    return compilerHost;    function resolveModuleNames(moduleNames: string[], containingFile: string) {     return moduleNames.map(moduleName => {       return resolveModuleName(moduleName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveModuleName).resolvedModule;     });   }    function resolveTypeReferenceDirectives(typeDirectiveNames: string[], containingFile: string) {     return typeDirectiveNames.map(typeDirectiveName => {       return resolveModuleName(typeDirectiveName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveTypeReferenceDirective).resolvedTypeReferenceDirective;     });   } } ```  ## License (MIT)  > **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison** > > Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: > > The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. > > THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).  ## API  ### Parsing  	URI.parse('uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//  scheme : 'uri', 	//  userinfo : 'user:pass', 	//  host : 'example.com', 	//  port : 123, 	//  path : '/one/two.three', 	//  query : 'q1=a1&q2=a2', 	//  fragment : 'body' 	//}  ### Serializing  	URI.serialize({scheme : 'http', host : 'example.com', fragment : 'footer'}) === 'http://example.com/#footer'  ### Resolving  	URI.resolve('uri://a/b/c/d?q', '../../g') === 'uri://a/g'  ### Normalizing  	URI.normalize('HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html') === 'http://abc.com/~smith/home.html'  ### Comparison  	URI.equal('example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D', 'eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d') === true  ### IP Support  	//IPv4 normalization 	URI.normalize('//192.068.001.000') === '//192.68.1.0'  	//IPv6 normalization 	URI.normalize('//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]') === '//[2001:0:db8::1]'  	//IPv6 zone identifier support 	URI.parse('//[2001:db8::7%25en1]'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//  host : '2001:db8::7%en1' 	//}  ### IRI Support  	//convert IRI to URI 	URI.serialize(URI.parse('http://examplé.org/rosé')) === 'http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9' 	//convert URI to IRI 	URI.serialize(URI.parse('http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9'), {iri:true}) === 'http://examplé.org/rosé'  ### Options  All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:  *	`scheme` (string)  	Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.  *	`reference` (string)  	If set to `'suffix'`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.  *	`tolerant` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.  *	`absolutePath` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.  *	`iri` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  *	`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  *	`domainHost` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).  ## Scheme Extendable  URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:  *	http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\] *	https \[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\] *	mailto \[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\] *	urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\] *	urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]  ### HTTP Support  	URI.equal('HTTP://ABC.COM:80', 'http://abc.com/') === true  ### Mailto Support  	URI.parse('mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : 'mailto', 	//	to : ['alpha@example.com', 'bravo@example.com'], 	//	subject : 'SUBSCRIBE', 	//	body : 'Sign me up!' 	//}  	URI.serialize({ 		scheme : 'mailto', 		to : ['alpha@example.com'], 		subject : 'REMOVE', 		body : 'Please remove me', 		headers : { 			cc : 'charlie@example.com' 		} 	}) === 'mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me'  ### URN Support  	URI.parse('urn:example:foo'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : 'urn', 	//	nid : 'example', 	//	nss : 'foo', 	//}  #### URN UUID Support  	URI.parse('urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : 'urn', 	//	nid : 'example', 	//	uuid : 'f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6', 	//}  ## Usage  To load in a browser, use the following tag:  	<script type='text/javascript' src='uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js'></script>  To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:  	npm install uri-js  Then, in your code, load it using:  	const URI = require('uri-js');  If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:  	import * as URI from 'uri-js';  Or you can load just what you need using named exports:  	import { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from 'uri-js';  ## Breaking changes  ### Breaking changes from 3.x  URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.  The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.  ### Breaking changes from 2.x  URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.  ### Breaking changes from 1.x  The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.  ## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))  Copyright 2011 Gary Court.

In many instances when I'm checking for object equality, what I really want to know is if their **values** are equal. This is good for:  - Stuff you keep in `localStorage` - `window.history.state` values - Query strings  ## Installation  Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):      $ npm install --save value-equal  Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:  ```js // using ES6 modules import valueEqual from 'value-equal'  // using CommonJS modules var valueEqual = require('value-equal') ```  The UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):  ```html <script src='https://unpkg.com/value-equal/umd/value-equal.min.js'></script> ```  You can find the library on `window.valueEqual`.  ## Usage  ```js valueEqual(1, 1)                           // true valueEqual('asdf', 'asdf')                 // true valueEqual('asdf', new String('asdf'))     // true valueEqual(true, true)                     // true valueEqual(true, false)                    // false valueEqual({ a: 'a' }, { a: 'a' })         // true valueEqual({ a: 'a' }, { a: 'b' })         // false valueEqual([ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 1, 2, 3 ])       // true valueEqual([ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 2, 3, 4 ])       // false ```  That's it.

"w3c-hr-time@1.0.1","MIT","https://github.com/jsdom/w3c-hr-time","# w3c-hr-time  This module implements the W3C [High Resolution Time Level 2][HR-TIME] specification. It provides exactly three exports:  - `Performance` class - `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS(): number` - `clockIsAccurate: boolean`  In all APIs, a 'high-resolution timestamp' means a number in milliseconds that may have a fractional part, if the system clock is accurate enough (see 'Clock accuracy' section below). It is identical to the [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`][] type in the High Resolution Time spec.  Portability is paramount to this module. It uses only APIs exposed from Node.js core like `Date.now()` and `process.hrtime()` and does not use or require any native modules. It also employs the [browser-process-hrtime][] module for graceful degrades for platforms that do not have `process.hrtime()` (such as browsers).  ## `Performance` class  ```js const { Performance } = require('w3c-hr-time'); const performance = new Performance();  console.log(performance.timeOrigin); // Prints a number close to Date.now() but that may have fractional parts, like // 1514888563819.351.  console.log(new Date(performance.timeOrigin)); // Prints a date close to new Date(), like 2018-01-02T10:22:43.819Z.  setTimeout(() => {   console.log(performance.now());   // Prints a number close to 5000, like 5008.023059. }, 5000); ```  Perhaps the most interesting export is the [`Performance`][] class. By constructing the class, you can get an instance quite similar to the `window.performance` object in browsers. Specifically, the following APIs are implemented:  * [`performance.now(): number`][`Performance#now()`] returns the high-resolution duration since the construction of the `Performance` object. * [`performance.timeOrigin: number`][`Performance#timeOrigin`] is a high-resolution timestamp of the `Performance` object's construction, expressed in [Unix time][]. * [`performance.toJSON(): object`][`Performance#toJSON()`] returns an object with `timeOrigin` property set to the corresponding value of this object. This allows serializing the `Performance` object with `JSON.stringify()`. In browsers, the returned object may contain additional properties such as `navigation` and `timing`. However, those properties are specific to browser navigation and are unsuitable for a Node.js implementation. Furthermore, they are specified not in the High Resolution Time spec but in [Navigation Timing][NAVIGATION-TIMING], and are thereby outside the scope of this module.  ### Limitations  This module does not aim for full [Web IDL][WEBIDL] conformance, so things like `performance.toJSON.call({})` will not throw `TypeError`s like it does in browsers. If you need full Web IDL conformance, you may be interested in the [webidl2js][] module.  The `Performance` class provided also does not have `mark()`, `measure()`, `getEntries()`, and such functions. They are specified in other specs than High Resolution Timing, such as [User Timing][USER-TIMING] (marks and measures) and [Performance Timeline][PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE] (entries management). Those specs extend the definition of the `Performance` class defined in High Resolution Timing, and to implement those specs you can extend the `Performance` class exported by this module.  Due to the limitations of the APIs exposed through Node.js, the construction of a `Performance` object may take up to 1 millisecond to gather information for high-resolution `timeOrigin`.  ## Global monotonic clock  The High Resolution Time spec defines a [global monotonic clock][] that is 'shared by time origin's *[sic]*, is monotonically increasing and not subject to system clock adjustments or system clock skew, and whose reference point is the Unix time.'  This module exports a function `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS()` that is the basis of all timing functions used my this module when a monotonic time is required. It returns a high-resolution timestamp whose zero value is at some arbitrary point in the past. (For the current high-resolution timestamp based on the Unix epoch, use `new Performance().timeOrigin` instead.)  ```js const { getGlobalMonotonicClockMS } = require('w3c-hr-time');  const start = getGlobalMonotonicClockMS(); console.log(start); // Prints a millisecond timestamp based on an arbitrary point in the past, like // 280249733.012151.  setTimeout(() => {   console.log(getGlobalMonotonicClockMS() - a);   // Prints a number close to 5000, like 5006.156536. }, 5000); ```  Unlike other functions that return only integer timestamps if the system clock does not provide enough resolution, this function may still return timestamps with fractional parts on those systems with less accurate clocks. See 'Clock accuracy' section below for more information.  ## Clock accuracy  The High Resolution Time spec [states][HR-TIME §4] that  > A [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`][] *SHOULD* represent a time in milliseconds accurate to 5 microseconds - see [8. Privacy and Security][HR-TIME §8]. > > If the User Agent is unable to provide a time value accurate to 5 microseconds due to hardware or software constraints, the User Agent can represent a [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`][] as a time in milliseconds accurate to a millisecond.  This module implements this suggestion faithfully. It executes a test at `require()`-time to determine if the system clock (both `Date.now()` and `process.hrtime()`) is accurate enough to 5 microseconds. The result of this test can be accessed through the exported `clockIsAccurate` boolean value.  ```js const { Performance, clockIsAccurate } = require('w3c-hr-time');  const performance = new Performance();  if (!clockIsAccurate) {   console.assert(Number.isInteger(performance.timeOrigin));   console.assert(Number.isInteger(performance.now())); } ```  If `clockIsAccurate` is false, `performance.timeOrigin` and `performance.now()` are always rounded to millisecond accuracy. `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS()` however is exempt from this requirement due to its best-effort nature, and the fact that it is not an API exposed by the High Resolution Time spec.  ## Clock drift  [Clock drift][clock drift] can be observed through system or user clock adjustments -- that is, the speed at which `Date.now()` changes may be faster or slower than real time if there is a pending adjustment to the system clock, for example through NTP synchronizing.  In the spec, the [global monotonic clock][] is defined to be immune to such drifts. Correspondingly, the APIs exposed through this module that are defined using the global monotonic clock such as `performance.now()` and `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS()` are also guaranteed to reflect real time.  For example, if `performance.now()` returns 1000, it is guaranteed that the time of this call is exactly one second since the construction of the `Performance` object. But the difference in `Date.now()`'s value from the construction of the `Performance` object to when `performance.now()` returns 1000 may not be exactly 1000. You may also see `performance.now() - Date.now()` diverge over time as a result of clock drifts.  On the other hand, `performance.timeOrigin` returns the *[Unix time][]* at which the `Performance` object is constructed and relies on the current time exposed through `Date.now()`. That means that it is susceptible to clock drifts that has occurred before the `Performance` object was constructed.

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner.

Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
